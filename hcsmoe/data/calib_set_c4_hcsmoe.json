The Chinese people are portrayed as dark, evil and unintelligent. \u00d3lafsson an Icelandic missionary creates the image through his two books \u201cMission in China\u201d and \u201c14 years in China\u201d.

{"text":"Homesense is a pilot program devised by the designers at Tinker London with the support of the energy company EDF and HighWire, a computing and design program at Lancaster University, UK. The program helps people develop their own smart homes, with systems that allow them to track and understand their energy usage but also to help with various tasks specific to their homes and lifestyles. The designers felt that previous attempts at smart homes, no matter how effective the technology, were too impersonal and kept users from feeling invested in the results. Homesense, by contrast, was developed with input from real households playing a part in the creation of their own devices and monitoring systems. Each household was paired with an expert who helped its members track various kinds of information and develop ideas for useful tools, such as a garbage bin that appears progressively angrier the more it is used and a device that waters plants for people too busy to do it themselves.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.moma.org\/interactives\/exhibitions\/2011\/talktome\/objects\/145465\/"}

{"text":"Technological advances in the digital era have substantially increased the ease with which copyright material can be reproduced and distributed. In recent times we have seen a number of legislative reforms, industry agreements and technological-based measures introduced internationally with the aim of preventing and regulating online copyright infringement.\nThis article focuses on website-blocking injunctions, as one such measure that has been used or introduced in a number of jurisdictions to tackle online copyright infringement. Direct enforcement of copyright against websites operated and hosted outside of the jurisdiction is notoriously difficult. Website-blocking injunctions enable a copyright owner to apply for an injunction requiring an ISP to block local access to such websites. This article focuses on the approach to blocking injunctions in Australia, the UK and Singapore. While legislation has only recently been introduced in Australia and Singapore, such injunctions have been used since 2011 in the UK and have been said to have had some effect reducing online copyright infringement.\nOn 22 June 2015, the Australian Government enacted the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Act 2015, which inserted a new injunction power into the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). The new section 115A gives the Federal Court of Australia the power to order an injunction to require an ISP to take reasonable steps to disable access to an online location located outside Australia with the primary purpose of infringing or facilitating infringement of copyright. Copyright owners must pursue existing remedies under the Copyright Act in relation to local websites.\nBefore making the order, the Court must be satisfied that the ISP provides access to an online location outside Australia, that the online location infringes or facilitates the infringement of copyright and that the primary purpose of the online location is to infringe or facilitate the infringement of copyright. The \u201cprimary\u201d purpose was an intentionally high threshold, intended to exclude websites that are mainly operated for a legitimate purpose, but contain a small percentage of infringing content. It was also intended to exclude Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that are promoted and used for legitimate purposes and websites that provide legitimate copyright material overseas, but are not licensed to distribute that material in Australia.\nThe Court, in its discretion, may also take into account a list of factors when determining whether to grant the injunction. These include the flagrancy of the infringement, whether the website has been blocked in another jurisdiction, whether blocking the website is a \u201cproportionate response\u201d, the public interest and the impact on any person, or any class of persons likely to be affected by the grant of the injunction.\nAn injunction may be granted regardless of whether the ISP has actual knowledge of the copyright infringement. The provisions are intended to create a \u201cno fault\u201d remedy. The website operator is not automatically a party to the proceeding, but may apply to the Court to be joined as a party. However, unless the Court dispenses with the notice requirement, the copyright owner must inform the operator of the online location of the injunction application.\nThere have not yet been any cases brought pursuant to s 115A in Australia.\nArticle 8(3) of the European Union Infosoc Directive  provides that \u201cMember States shall ensure that right holders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third-party to infringe a copyright or related right\u201d. The CJEU in UPC Telekabel Wien GmbH v Constantin Film Verleih GmbH and Ors (C-314\/12) recently confirmed that ISPs can be ordered to block access to a website without specifying the measures to be taken. An ISP must take all \u201creasonable\u201d measures, taking into account the right of internet users to freedom of information.\nIn considering whether the Court should exercise its discretion to make the order, the Court must consider whether the relief sought is proportionate (whether the likely costs burden on the ISPs is justified by the efficacy of the blocking measures and the consequent benefit to the rights holders). When assessing proportionality, matters for the Court to consider include the availability of alternative measures, the efficacy, costs and dissuasiveness of the measures, and the impact on lawful users of the internet.\nInitially, the grant of the blocking injunctions pursuant to s 97A was opposed by ISPs, as was the scope of the injunction to be granted. However, following the first few such decisions, the essential principles relating to s 97A website blocking orders have been settled and many orders have been made on the papers.\nSince 2010, the UK courts have ordered ISPs to block a large number of websites pursuant to s 97A. The list of blocked websites maintained by UK ISP TalkTalk currently names 590 websites that are blocked.\nThe Singaporean website blocking provisions were introduced by the Copyright Amendment Act 2014 (Singapore) and are contained in ss 193DDA-193DDB of the Singaporean Copyright Act (Chapter 63).\nUnder the Singaporean legislation, the High Court can issue an injunction that requires a network services provider to take \u201creasonable steps to disable access\u201d to a \u201cflagrantly infringing online location\u201d if it is satisfied that the services of the network service provider are being used to commit or facilitate infringement of copyright. The High Court must have regard to a list of factors when making an order, including the harm that has been caused, the burden on the ISP, technical feasibility, effectiveness, possible adverse effects and other comparatively effective orders. The Court must consider a further list of factors in determining whether an online location is being used to flagrantly commit or facilitate infringement, which are similar to the factors considered under s 115A of the Australian legislation.\nBefore applying for an order, the copyright owner must notify the online location, although the Court may dispense with the notice requirements. The online location owner has a \u201cright to be heard\u201d on the application for an injunction and any appeal.\nThe Singaporean High Court has not yet handed down any decisions under the new provisions.\nConcerns have been raised over the potential impact of website-blocking injunctions on freedom of expression and legitimate content. The website owner or operator is not generally active in the proceeding and there are concerns that legal content may be blocked given that the hearing is effectively ex parte. Concerns have been raised that there may be \u201cover-blocking\u201d, where other non-infringing websites are blocked in error, such as because they are hosted at the same IP addresses. However, under the UK orders, safeguards have been introduced so that an interested party may apply to discharge or vary the order, and this might similarly be adopted in Australia and Singapore.\nIt has also been argued that website-blocking injunctions are ineffective. ISP-level blocking is relatively easy to evade (the so-called \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d effect). In the UK, to address this issue, ISPs are required to block the named website and when notified in writing, any other IP address or URL whose sole or predominant purpose is to facilitate access to the named website. Mr Justice Arnold recently considered the efficacy of website-blocking orders in the Cartier decision  and concluded that although experienced and determined users would be able to circumvent the blocking measures, blocking websites has proved to be reasonably effective in reducing use of those websites in the UK.\nThe website-blocking injunctions are but one part of a raft of measures that have been introduced to address copyright infringement, although the measure is not without controversy and criticisms of its efficacy. The Australian Government has committed to reviewing the new injunction power 18 months after commencement and it will certainly be interesting to examine evidence of the effect of the injunction power on online copyright infringement.\n Explanatory Memorandum, Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015 at  and .\n Revised Explanatory Memorandum, Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015 at .\n Explanatory Memorandum, Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015 at .\n European Parliament and Council Directive on the Harmonisation of Certain Aspects of Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society 2001\/29\/EC of 22 May 2001.\n Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation v Sky UK Limited  EWHC 1082 (Cth) per Birss J at .\n Cartier International AG & Ors v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd & Ors  EWHC 3354 (Ch) per Arnold J at .\n Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation v Newzbin Limited  EWHC 608 (Cth) and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation & Ors v British Telecommunications plc  EWHC 1981 (Ch).\n Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation v Sky UK Limited  EWHC 1082 (Cth) per Birss J at  to , citing Arnold J in Cartier International AG & Ors v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd & Ors  EWHC 3354 (Ch).\n As at 31 October 2015 <http:\/\/help2.talktalk.co.uk\/access-restricted-certain-file-sharing-websites>, noting that this includes some websites blocked for trade mark infringement.\n Cartier International AG & Ors v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd & Ors  EWHC 3354 (Ch) per Arnold J at -.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.kwm.com\/en\/es\/knowledge\/insights\/website-blocking-injunctions-to-combat-the-increasing-risk-of-online-copyright-infringement-20151109"}

{"text":"As part of the Vivid Vocal Visionary celebration on March 18, Teresa Younger will be joining Women\u2019s Fund CEO, Donna Haghighat, for a \u201ctalk show\u201d style conversation about investing in women and girls. Teresa is familiar with Western Massachusetts as she previously served as the executive director of the Connecticut General Assembly\u2019s Permanent Commission on the Status of Women and as executive director of the ACLU of Connecticut \u2013 making her the first African American and the first woman to hold that position. Although she works in New York, Teresa resides in Connecticut.\nTeresa is a renowned thought leader, strategist, advocate, activist and amplifier having spent over 20 years on the frontlines of some of the most critical battles affecting the lives of women and their communities. Under Teresa\u2019s leadership at Ms. Foundation, the Foundation launched #MyFeminismls, a multimedia campaign sparking a national conversation on feminism; funded a groundbreaking report on the sexual abuse to prison pipeline; joined leading women\u2019s foundations at the White House (under the Obama Administration) to announce a $100 million funding commitment to create pathways to economic opportunity for low-income women and girls; and led a campaign to hold the NFL accountable for violence against women. Most recently, Teresa led the development of the Ms. Foundation\u2019s bold new strategic plan, in which the organization has chosen to center women and girls of color to challenge the philanthropic sector (and all of us) around how women, particularly women and girls of color, are being invested in.\nDonna invited Teresa to be the guest speaker for the Vivid Vocal Visionary event because the Ms. Foundation\u2019s new strategic plan closely aligns with the recent focus of the Women\u2019s Fund on young women and girls of color through the Young Women\u2019s Initiative, as well as a shared goal to have more women step into political leadership. Donna and Teresa first met in Connecticut when Teresa was the executive director for the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women and Donna was the executive director at Aurora Foundation for Women and Girls in Greater Hartford.\nTeresa sits at the critical intersections of gender and race in the philanthropic space serving on initiatives to shape and change the narrative of women and girls, including Grantmakers for Girls of Color, Funders for Reproductive Equity, Philanthropy New York, and Black Funders for Social Justice. Additionally, Teresa serves on a number of boards including the Ethel Walker School and Essie Justice Group. She is a proud lifetime Girl Scout and Gold Award recipient.\nWe\u2019re excited to be able to introduce Teresa to our supporters on March 18th. Learn more about the Vivid Vocal Visionary event here. Tickets for the program and dinner are $125 individual and $1250 for a table of ten. All proceeds support the mission of the Women\u2019s Fund. The celebration honors the Women\u2019s Fund founders Dianne Fuller Doherty, Sally Livingston, and Martha Richards, as well as Kristi Nelson, founding executive director.\nSponsorship and program ad opportunities can be found here.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.mywomensfund.org\/get-to-know-teresa-younger\/"}

{"text":"SUNRISE, Fla. -- The New York Rangers weren't necessarily impressed with their performance Wednesday night, but they weren't going to complain about their bounce-back effort.\nTwo nights after being shut out by the Tampa Bay Lightning and seeing goalie Henrik Lundqvist pulled, the Rangers rebounded with a 5-2 victory against the Florida Panthers.\nThe Rangers appeared headed for an easy victory when they led 3-0 midway through the third period, but they had to respond after Florida cut the lead to 3-2 on goals by Scottie Upshall and Nick Bjugstad less than four minutes apart.\n\"Tampa Bay wasn't a 5-0 game,\" Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said. \"I don't think tonight was a 5-2 game, but we did win, and there's a saying in hockey: You never critique a win. So, I'm not going to start right now.\"\nDerick Brassard, Brad Richards and Rick Nash scored to give the Rangers their 3-0 lead, and Mats Zuccarello scored the Rangers' second power-play goal of the game with 1:28 remaining to seal the outcome. Carl Hagelin added an empty-netter with 23.1 seconds left.\nThe Rangers, whose 48 goals coming into the game were second fewest in the Eastern Conference, ahead of Buffalo's 44, matched their season-high with the five goals.\n\"The Rangers scored five goals; we haven't said that very often this year,\" Vigneault said. \"Some guys are hopefully going to continue on that roll.\"\nNew York recorded 5-1 victories against the Carolina Hurricanes and Pittsburgh Penguins.\nThe Rangers (13-12-0) improved to 3-1-0 on a five-game road trip that ends Friday against the Boston Bruins.\nThe Rangers have won seven of their past eight road games. They had a six-game road winning streak snapped with the loss at Tampa Bay.\n\"It was a weird game,\" Nash said. \"The main thing is we got the job done on the road.\"\nLundqvist, who was pulled after allowing four goals in the 5-0 loss to Tampa Bay, finished with 31 saves.\n\"I just tried to play my game tonight,\" Lundqvist said. \"It was important for me and the team to bounce back with a solid performance. You feel the importance of trying to get points. I'm happy with the way I played. The biggest part of this game was the two points.\"\nUpshall scored with 7:32 left in the third period to end Lundqvist's bid for his 48th career shutout, and Bjugstad scored with 3:43 left in the third to make things interesting.\nFlorida goalie Tim Thomas made his 10th consecutive start and stopped 17 shots. His career record against the Rangers dropped to 5-11-3.\n\"It's tough getting down,\" Bjugstad said. \"We always show a lot of fight coming back. I think the main thing is just showing the fight before we have to come back. We've got room for improvement, but a lot of guys are getting better.\"\nFlorida, which came in with the worst power-play percentage in the NHL, went 0-for-2 with the man advantage, failing to record a shot on goal on either opportunity.\nThe Rangers, who had gone 0-for-9 in their previous two games, were 2-for-3 on the power play.\nFlorida controlled the early part of the first period, at one point recording four shots in a nine-second span, before Brassard opened the scoring 12:13 in with a gorgeous power-play goal. After four crisp passes in the Florida zone, Brassard finished off the play by redirecting Zuccarello's feed in the slot over Thomas' left shoulder.\nZuccarello later ended Florida's comeback bid when he backhanded a loose puck in front of the net past Thomas.\n\"The power play goes up and down; you just have to stick with it,\" Zuccarello said. \"Today, we had some lucky bounces. It was nice to get them in.\"\nFlorida came in having posted a 3-1-1 record in its past five games.\nNew York has won both meetings against Florida this season, also winning 4-3 at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 10. The teams will meet for the third and final time this season on New Year's Eve at BB&T Center.\nLeft wing Taylor Pyatt returned to the Rangers lineup after missing eight games because of a concussion.\nRichards increased the Rangers lead to 2-0 at 18:53 of the second period with a seemingly harmless snap shot from the top of the right circle that got past Thomas after going through the legs of Florida defensemen Tom Gilbert and Brian Campbell.\nRichards came in with one goal in his previous 16 games.\nThomas with a low wrist shot to the stick side.\n\"I wouldn't say it was one of our best games, but at the end of the day, we found a way to win,\" Vigneault said. \"And finding ways to win is the goaltender making some key saves at the right moment; we got that. The power play was good in the opportunities that we had.\n\"Tonight, compared to some other nights, when they did make a mistake, we were able to make them pay for it. They didn't make a lot of mistakes, but when they did, we did what you have to do, and that's why we won the game.\"\nBut the Rangers didn't win without getting a scare.\n\"I felt it was a very good effort from the start right to the finish,\" Upshall said. \"It was a [game decided on special teams]. They got two power-play goals that were big goals in the game. They've got a world-class goalie, too, over there that really played well and stood on his head. There were good chances both ways for both teams. Both teams played really hard. It was a tough game.\"","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.nhl.com\/news\/rangers-hang-on-to-beat-panthers\/c-141252"}

{"text":"To provide state-of-the-art analytical support to CCEH research projects. To develop new methodologies for sensitive and quantitative analyses of key biomarkers (e.g., oxylipids, tryptophan metabolites, opioid peptides) and xenobiotic markers in human and animal samples.\nResearchers in the Analytical Core have developed an impressive array of analytical platforms for analyzing small molecular weight metabolites and xenobiotics to trypic fragments and intact proteins. The Core has also developed radioimmunoassay for PBDEs, non-coplanar PCBs, and new generation pesticides such as fipronil.\nMetal Analyses. Dr. Green has completed multi-element metals analysis on over 300 CHARGE whole blood samples using 250 \u00b5L aliquots. The 2-5 year old children in the study showed great variations in total Hg concentrations (~100-fold range), a moderate variation of Pb (~10-fold), and relatively narrow variation in the levels of about two-dozen other elements. The Core tested standards from New York State that include two lower levels of 1.7 and 3.1\u00b5g\/dL Pb and there was excellent agreement with our Core results, especially at lower levels. Several children were flagged for Hg levels above the US EPA safe guideline concentration of 5.8 ppb, and Center Administration was alerted. Letters were sent to the parents of these participants indicating the findings, an explanation, and recommendations. A fact sheet giving steps to reduce mercury exposure was included.\nHg analysis in mouse tissues has been performed in support of Project 3. Using instrumentation at the UC Davis Interdisciplinary Center for Plasma Mass Spectrometry, we developed a method for Hg analysis in hair as well as other elements. Using the typical growth rate of 1 cm\/month, this technique can provide temporal resolution of Hg arrival in the scalp, and using Laser Ablation does not require sample cleaning, extraction, or digestion. We are developing a method for the trace analysis of methyl-Hg and ethyl-Hg in blood and possibly hair and other relevant samples using chromatography coupled to ICP-MS.\nNutritional and structural lipids in serum samples. CHARGE samples that included autistic children, siblings, typically developing children, and MR\/DD children were analyzed by the Lipomics lipid metabolomics platform. Sample quality was found to be acceptable; the variations in lipid composition within the samples were within ranges of previously measured populations of humans. Strikingly, even in preliminary analysis of this small dataset, differences in the lipid profiles of children with autism and unaffected siblings were detected. Data analysis should be complete by early 2006.\nMetabolomic analysis of urine. We have developed an LC-MS\/MS method for profiling urinary peptides to explore the opioid excess theory in autism. This hypothesis proposes that autism could be the consequence of the action of exogenous peptides derived from an incomplete breakdown of gluten and casein. The opioid peptides gliadinomorphin, derived from wheat gliadin, and \u03b2-caseomorphin, derived from bovine casein, were used as lead compounds. A set of 77 urine samples have been analyzed, but neuropeptides above the detection limit were not found. Thus, the opioid peptide excess theory was not validated with this sample set.\nMetabolomic analysis of plasma. Another important class of metabolites that might provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of autism are oxidized lipids derived from the arachidonic acid and linoleic acid cascades, which are recognized as mediators of inflammatory and proliferative responses. This might be important in the case of ASD, since children with autism often manifest mild to moderate degrees of gastrointestinal inflammation. We have developed a novel LC\/MS\/MS-based method to routinely measure about 40 metabolites of arachidonate and linoleate metabolism emanating from COX, LOX, and cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism. CHARGE plasma samples from autistic and control children are currently being analyzed for oxylipids.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/cfpub.epa.gov\/ncer_abstracts\/index.cfm\/fuseaction\/display.abstractDetail\/abstract\/7872\/report\/2005"}
{"text":"Tazara has unfavourable debt and equity ratio which closes opportunities for accessing long term operational loans from any financial institution.The company needs more than US$700 million to operate smoothly. In addition it owes the statutory authorities round $100m. These include NAPSA, ZSIC and ZRA. And as if that was not enough, it is still owing TAZARA retirees more than $20m. The list is endless as this does not include legal fees and money owed in other areas.\nTAZARA\u2019s fundamental problem is that, even if it were well capitalized and managed, the rationale for its existence largely disappeared once sanctions against Rhodesia \/ Zimbabwe were lifted and the border re-opened. In recent years the expansion of Beira, Nacala, Walvis and other regional ports has further reduced the need for heavy investment in TAZARA. With RSZ itself having substantial surplus capacity, it is doubtful whether there is sufficient traffic for one railway, let alone two.\nWhich brings us to the basic question - if not TAZARA, where should government prioritise investment? The answer is clear : roads! Zambia suffers from a \"landlocked trap\". We are heavily dependent on our neighbours for road and rail access to sea. However, even in terms of internal road network, Zambia has not invested significantly enough compared to other aspirational African countries. In other words, its okay that we have neighbours with poor road or rail network or insufficient port capacity, but there's no reason why cannot do our bit, to get road network in order! Its no surprise therefore that evidence appears to suggest that Zambia's lack of adequate infrastructure is acting as a constraint on the expansion of trade and economic activity. The World Bank's Logistics Performance Index, ranks Zambia's transport infrastructure below the average of other sub-Saharan African countries and low-income countries.\nMany of our local areas are isolated and in desperate need of good accessible rural infrastructure. With good roads accessibility improves in terms of delivery of services and local commerce. Without proper rural roads it becomes impossible to make serious efforts in improving market development. Good roads reduce local market failures in critical sectors such as agriculture and tourism.\nThe PF government therefore should continue to rightly prioritize investments in rural roads over rail because roads have a greater potential to directly affect the poor and enable them to become players in the market. Minister Mukanga is performing exceptionally well in delivering at pace the Link 8000, Lusaka 400 and Pave Zambia 2000 projects. Zambia is on course for total transformation of its road network thanks to the excellent priority President Sata has placed on these project. My prayer is that the Minister and the President do not get distracted with TAZARA issues.\nThe Government should press ahead and sell TAZARA - but who would buy it?","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/www.zambian-economist.com\/2013\/10\/saving-tazara.html"}
{"text":"The minimum level for this dungeon is 110. The location of the entrance to Antorus, the Burning Throne is in the Antoran Wastes zone on the continent of Argus. The contains 11 bosses. The end boss of Antorus, the Burning Throne is Argus the Unmaker.\nAntorus is the final raid on the Legion expansion. It is located on the far off planet Argus which is referred to as the Legion home world. Antorus is a large castle building in the Antoran Wastes hence its name. The dungeon is very green when you visit.\nThe final boss is Argus, the Unmaker. Whilst most bosses were released on the test server, Argus was held back to make things a bit more interesting for the people who like to fight for the prestige of being the first person to kill Argus.\nThe Gorothi Worldbreaker is like previous bosses that you'll have come across in the past such as Krosus in Nighthold, the raid that was released the last but one. The boss is half above the ground and half below ground.\nThe main thing to remember with this boss is that he does a lot of AOE damage everywhere so you need to keep moving. He'll target a player and that player will need to move out of the way of the target zone otherwise s\/he'll be playing the harp. If you get targetted for missiles, you need to move to the back of the room as quickly as possible. There are no adds but he will open up a cannon which you need to target and destroy as quickly as possible.\nThe melee and those ranged dps who like to fight up close and personal need to be aware of Eradication. Eradication is where Worldbreaker will bang on the ground and cause AOE damage, move out of the way and then move back when he's stopped.\nEven extremely bad Titans have pets, F'harg (yellow) and Shatug (blue). As there are two pets and two tanks in each raid, one tank per pet. Unlike some bosses where one supertank can take on both, it is advised you wait for another tank before you confront them in LFR. The two pets must be tanked away from each other because they both have a different attack move that will cause massive damage to the players.\nF'harg main unique fighting move is that he'll explode with light and cause damage. Shatug will create black holes which are blue balls and pull people toward them. It is a relatively easy boss if you get the mechanics right.\nF'Harg wiill poison the ground in the three directions. All you need to do is to move out of the way so that you avoid damage. Once the poison has gone, you can return to the area to fight. Its been known that all the dps target one of the bosses, normally Shatug because they are shared health and its aoe spell can be best avoided.\nyou're lucky enough, the mount might fall and it will even fall in the LFR raid and not just the normal+ raids.\nThe Antoran High Command might look like just one corrupted Draenei but its not, there are three Draenei but only one appears at anyone time. Each time another one appears, the group needs to move to another part of the fighting area. The closer you get to killing the bosses, the quicker the interval you need to move to another boss.\nThe three bosses are all very similar mechanics and they all share the same health pool. Unlike the previous bosses here, these bosses will have adds which are more of a nuisance than damaging. The lights will go dim during the fight but will return.\nThings you need to be aware of is that Chief Engineer Ishkar will unleash hellfire so you need to get under the shield that appears. General Erodus has landmines which you need to avoid, they are easy to spot, they are large and green on the ground.\nDon't start this fight if you only have one tank as it might be a bit difficult. As the name suggests, Hasabel opens portals to other parts of the fight zone which dps and healers need to jump through to kill the boss adds. The adds are :- Vulcanar, Lady Dacidion and Lord Ellgar. The adds are easy enough to kill. Vulcanar as his name suggests is a Vulcano creature that spews fire. Lord Ellgar makes vision difficult and small.\nThe tanks need to keep movng Hasabel around the fight area. Hasabel will create large areas of shadow damage which is why you need to keep moving the boss around the fight area.\nThere is a real boss here like in the other encounters. The encounter takes place in Eonar's home world if you can say that. It is reminiscent of the conservatory area in Ulduar. The fight involves running around the platformed area killing adds. If you fall off, you can ported back onto a platform. Eonar is a titan that the Legion seeks to corrupt but one that you aimn to prevent. There is no large ultimate boss at the end.\nImonar will drop from a Legion craft in the middle of the room so its advisable that everyone stays on the outside of the fight zone so that you don't accidentally start it. The mechanics are easy, Imonar is a bounty hunter for the Legion and according to him, the more you fight, the more the bounty is. He doesn't have any adds that you need to be aware of. Just as there is no adds, it doesn't make it any easier for the fight.\nThe main thing to be aware of is him elevating himself and flying to the other end of the fight zone. In between the two fight areas are land mines which cause damage to you and surrounding people. If you're a Warlock, you can create portals to cross the area. You'll only be able to use the portal in one direction as other people will probably use it to and therefore drain the power to use it.\nThis boss is tricky but the mechanics are easy if you pay attention. During the fight, he'll summon from a portal a Decimator. When the summoning is happening, Kin'garoth will be immune to dps so all need to run to the Decimator. When the Decimator comes out of the portal, run to the main area otherwise you'll die when the ground becomes poisonous. At the same time as the portal, the boss no longer is immune. One of the tanks needs to pick up the boss whilst the other keeps the Decimator in check.\nThe group needs to keep moving round and the tank needs to kite the add round at the same time. Every so often, Kin'garoth will fire a beam from his hook hand, so you need to move round clockwise otherwise you'll die. Its best to dps him from behind so you have enough time to react to the stream. In addition to the stream, be aware of the mana balls which need to be avoided otherwise damage will ensue.\nCompared to the other bosses, this one is easy. The tanks need to tank him away from the rest of the group, with Varimathras facing the wall. The rest need to be behind the boss and hit him till he's dead. The only thing you need to worry about is the shadow damage he creates on the ground in which case you need to move out of the way. Once the shadow damage has gone, return back to fight him.\nAlthough there are three Shivaras, you only face two at anyone time. The third jumps on a column to cause mayhem. It is best to stack the two bosses that are in play together so that they can receive the dpses damage. During the fight, one of the bosses will step out of the fight and another will return.\nThe main thing with this fight is that there will a number of different adds that will cause pain. The adds will take on the form of spectres. The Spectres will have the names of Torment and then the names of the Pantheon. When the Spectres appear all round the room, it is at that point you need to find a break in surrounding wall and run towards it. Failure to run out of the fight area will cause damage and most likely death if you're in the poison for too long. When the wall is moving in, you should not try to dps the adds as you'll died.\nIn addition to the poison on the grounds, the Spectres will also through electricity on people so you need to heal them up as quickly as possible.\nLike so many previous bosses, there will be a line of damage that will fire out from the centre of the bosses so you need to move out of the way. Another piece of damage is the swirling swords which are easy to move out of the way of.\nBeing on the European Aggramar server, not too happy that Aggramar is not the last, final boss of the expansion but subordinate to Argus :( Ah well. You could say that he is the final boss of the Burning Throne because the final boss takes place at the Seat of the the Pantheon, where the Titans live. Aggramar is a fallen titan who Sargeras corrupted and persuaded to help.\nThe main things things you need to be aware of is that the clue is in the name as to what you'll face with him. He main powers are fire. He'll launch fire blades out in all in directions so people need to be ready for them twhen they happen and side step them. If you can remember back to End Time and when you had to fight Echo of Jaina, she would throw frost blades across the ground, well, this is a variety on that.\nHe'll create a large of area of fire from which you need to move out of the way quickly otherwise you'll be damaged.\nDuring the fire, flame adds will appear from where he is standing. You need to kite and kill them as soon as possible. These flame elementals can and will merge if they are not killed quickly enough. Found Aggramar to be tougher than Argus but if you take things carefully then he's killable.\nArgus, the Unmaker is the final boss of the Legion expansion. You sadly don't get to face off against the big bad guy, Sargeras in this expansion. You may get the chance later but the question to be asked is how do you kill a Titan, a God. Anyway, back to this boss. You have been teleported to the Seat of the Pantheon, where the Titans sit on their seats to watch down on the universe.\nThe fight is in a number of phases. Phase 1, you fight Argus on his own. His large Scythe swipes the area so all the dps should stand behind him so that they can't be hit by his sweeps. He'll create large areas of damage so you need to be nimble and move out of the way otherwise its curtains for you.\nWhen you get to about 30% in the LFR version anyway, he'll disappear and ghostly adds will appear. You need to kill each of the adds before you get them. You should concentrate on taking one at a time at least in LFR.\nWhen all the ghostly figures have been killed, Argus will come back and kill you all just like that. You'll be revived by another of the Titans where you need to run to the tree to revive. Whilst you are doing the ghost run, you will see sha like creatures roaming, in the LFR version, these monsters can be ignored. However for higher levels, the shas will attack you, otherwise whats the point of haing them. You'll probably die multiple times in the fight and each time, you run to the tree and res. The tree will only have a finite amount of times that you can be ressed so make dying as sparing as possible.\nOnce Argus is dead, the cartoon will begin and will show the Titans revealing Sargeras. Sargeras will ram his sword into Azeroth, Silithus to be more precise. Silithus was chosen because it has the least number of players visiting it than any other zone and besides its on the coast as well. Sargeras is imprisoned by the rest of the Titans. As Sargeras isn't killed, he could well escape from prison and therefore return in a future expansion but not for the next few expansions.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.universeguide.com\/games\/dungeon\/antorustheburningthrone"}
{"text":"Now here's a game that went TOTALLY under my radar back in the day. I've been confused about this one since first hearing about it on the net only just a few years ago (at the time of this writing)!\nNamely: why didn't I SEE, much less play this game *ANYWHERE*? I can't believe I never saw this one, even though it's categorized as to supposedly getting a \"wide release\" back then, according to its entry in its Killer List of Video Games page. I could understand if I lived in a small town that never had an arcade, but I lived in freakin' HOUSTON, for God's sake! The fourth largest city in the country! Memorial City Mall, at one point, I do believe had literally *five* game rooms at one time, with Kyptar's and Celebrity Cafe having several dozen games apiece!\nWell, whatever happened with this game, it was a ROM hack with just different-looking levels than the original, but its gameplay was left pretty much intact. A few interesting notes include Level 12 looking almost exactly like 13 from the original (plus level 11 is a more \"bumpy\" version of the original level 11), whereas levels five and nine not only takes up only the right half of the screen, but they're so hard to see what the hell's going on you have to turn your head to the side, since everything's squished to the left side! So you have to tilt your head to the left to try to view it better (and then on top of THAT, level 10 is also tilted at a freakin' angle to boot! Whee!)!\nThe graphics and sounds are the exact same as the original, and the gameplay is mostly the same, there's just a few play mechanics that have slightly changed due to funky level design (like the ones with the \"dead ends\" that I mentioned). I assume the control was the exact same as the original's, having the spinner and all, but I can't say for sure since I never saw or played this one in an arcade, so I'm leaving that blank in the ratings column.\nThis really isn't that much of an upgrade from the original, and due to some levels being nearly impossible to tell what's going on at times, isn't quite as fun. It's just pretty much for bragging rights saying that you've got this in your game room\/collection, for those that have a Tempest machine with this ROM installed (I've seen listings for such a thing on an arcade mailing list I'm on). Other than that, it doesn't really do much for the original. Heck, I couldn't even think of many sarcastic things to say with this one.\nOh, I know! Why did the Tempest fan cross the road? To try to find an arcade that had Tempest (Tubes) in it!\nBut are the look is the same for Tempest Tubes.","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/ataritimes.com\/index.php?ArticleIDX=619"}
{"text":"The word solstice is formed from Latin sol, \u201csun\u201d, and sistere, \u201cto come to a stop, to stand still\u201d.\nSo the Sun stands still at this time of year, either at the zenith or the nadir of the annual cycle, depending on the hemisphere in which you dwell. Either way, it is the point of \u00ab enantiodromia \u00bb, the still point from which the return to the opposite commences: winter starts moving towards summer, and the days slowly grow; summer starts moving towards winter, and the nights inexorably increase. Together north and south form a dance, like a double spiral, expanding and contracting in relation to each other's activity.\nIf you're at the winter-point of this cycle, plant the seeds that determine the arc of your next six months. If you're at the summer-point of this cycle, you are at the culmination of seeds already cast, and your arc will begin its decline. Plan how you will harvest your fruits.\nIn terms of religious symbolism, it may be noted that Christ is traditionally born at the nadir of the year, in the midst of wintery death, signifying light emerging from darkness. In Spring, when the world shakes off Winter's shackles and comes to life, Christ is killed and overcomes death. Once again, it holds to the principle that each pole contains its opposite. Birth in the midst of death; death in the midst of life. \u201cIn the midst of winter\u201d, remarks Albert Camus, \"I discovered within me an invincible summer (Au milieu de l\u2018hiver, j'ai d\u00e9couvert en moi un invincible \u00e9t\u00e9).","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/www.aaroncheak.com\/news\/2014\/12\/22\/the-sun-stands-still"}
{"text":"Graciela Iturbide was invited to participate in the registry of the opening and was able to capture Frida\u2019s domestic spaces with a fine eye. Surprisingly, she began to discover another Frida and to interpret her objects \u2014prosthetics, corsets, medicines, stuffed animals, posters of Stalin\u2014, capturing fleeting and unrepeatable moments. She decided to organized an exhibition of the material she gathered, which was held in the Mexico City airport.\nIn the manner of a visual poetics, the photographer creates still lifes from what she found. These twenty-eight images evoke Frida\u2019s interior world and her dominating personality. We see her private intimacy laid bare without limits or conventionalism. We see close up objects as intimate and unknown as the earrings Picasso gave Frida as a gift, and the notebooks, writings, and books \u2014with feathers or dried flowers placed to mark a significant page\u2014 which allow us a glimpse of another version of the artist.\nThe project from which this book emerges - conceived by Natalia Gil and later exhibited at the Old College of San Ildefonso and in Monterrey, Brazil, Chile and Spain - shows the imaginary dialogue between the work of three photographers: the Hindu Raghu Rai, the Mexican Graciela Iturbide and the Brazilian Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado. The splendid photographs of these three masters show the similarities and particularities of two peoples that seem geographically and culturally distant, with their human conglomerates, their urban landscapes and their daily life.\nThe leading line of the exhibition that gives rise to this book is the meeting of three personal ways in which art can approach photography. The three artists who join this project -Gabriel Orozco, Richard Wentworth and Fischli & Weiss- find in this technique a means to portray their street findings within the urban landscape, its surroundings and its objects.\nOne hundred years after the birth of the Mexican photographer Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo, this book contains a selection of one hundred of his most emblematic images chosen by himself and accompanied by the pen of his own friends: Texts by Edward Weston, Langston Hughes, Luis Cardoza and Arag\u00f3n, Andr\u00e9 Breton, Diego Rivera, Xavier Villaurrutia, Juan Garc\u00eda Ponce and Francisco Toledo, among others.\nManuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo is an indispensable figure in the history of twentieth-century photography, a friend of artists and intellectuals in a century of contrasts. Here are the images who speak, images of the everyday that leave wonder in the open.\nFondo para Ni\u00f1os de M\u00e9xico is a non-governmental organization that promotes the development of children living in poverty. This publication, illustrated with photographs taken by children from deprived areas of Mexico, offers the point of view of the youngest to show the needs and life of a vulnerable sector of the country.\nTexts by Antonio Tabucchi, Susan Sontag, Nadine Gordimer, Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re, \u00c1lvaro Mutis, among others.\nEighty-one renowned writers participate in this project with an unpublished text about some of the photographs of Fundaci\u00f3n Televisa's collections. The result is a very heterogeneous book, with images ranging from one of the first photographic shots, to others that became twentieth-century icons and contemporary works. In the same way, the texts go from story to essay, and even poetry, from some that give a story to the image, to others whose critical view affects the very act of capturing the moment, the decisive moment.\nThis book presents 31 photographs of the artist, taken in places as diverse as Florida and Louisiana, United States; England; India, and the desert of Sonora and Oaxaca, in Mexico.\nThe research that gives rise to this publication arises from the need to make available to the public a sample of the photographic production of our country and a recount of its protagonists.\nToday, more than 160 years after the birth of photography, this book evokes that history with the images of more than 610 authors, from pioneers to contemporaries. This work originates in the Archive of the Image Center, which houses nearly eight hundred creative and research projects.\nThe Casasola archive is composed of almost five hundred thousand photographs, which offer a wide horizon of images and visual proposals and that account for the interest, unprecedented in its time, for collecting photographs, a novelty that is one of the contributions by Agust\u00edn V\u00edctor Casasola to the patrimony of Mexico. This volume gives an account of the conformation of this historical collection, and presents a wide sample of the photographs belonging to its archive.\nDisciple of Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo and Gabriel Figueroa, H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda is considered one of the most important Mexican photographers. His work has been recognized with the National Prize for Science and Arts in 2002, and he has received the National Journalism Prize three times. Francisco Montellano says of him: \"Witness and protagonist throughout his life of countless big and small events, the H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda archive is full of themes and derivations of the history of Mexico in the last 60 years\". This edition features 150 photographs, and includes an introduction by the curator of the Department of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and an anthology of critical texts on the work of the artist.\nGabriel Figueroa has been the most important film photographer that Mexico has given, and his work was considered by the muralists themselves as a \"moving\" representative of this artistic movement.\nThis vast project, coordinated by Figueroa's son, Gabriel Figueroa Flores, includes both personal and professional graphic material, from his first photographs -of which the original negatives are conserved- to portraits of actors, artists and writers of the era, like Marilyn Monroe or Juan Rulfo, as well as a selection of digitally restored frames.\nHistory of Luis Bu\u00f1uel's film, premiered in 1950 in Mexico City and named part of the documentary archive Memory of the World of UNESCO, and on which essays, critiques and reflections by authors as well known as Julio Cort\u00e1zar have been written, Octavio Paz and Claude Mauriac, to name a few. This social document about Mexico presents for the first time the complete script of the film illustrated with photograms, the history of how the film was made and who participated in it (such as Gabriel Figueroa, Max Aub and Rodolfo Halffter), the count of the other end that was not seen and the impact that this film had in its time.\nSince the 1980s, graffiti has emerged in Mexico City from the United States after passing through Tijuana and Guadalajara as one of the most constant but little-explored manifestations of culture. This practice is carried out by an extensive community, initially underground, which soon becomes an urban phenomenon of enormous dimensions.\nIn this publication, the author analyzes the origins of graffiti as well as the complex socio-cultural relationships that surround it. The research, carried out through a meticulous fieldwork, shows the work done by graffiti artists and their crews in just over thirty years, traces a line from the origins of graffiti to our days and interviews 21 protagonists to bring the reader to the world of graffiti. A glossary of terms used by graffiti artists is included.\nProfusely illustrated with a wide selection of graffiti (styles, signatures, messages and pieces), this publication has counted on the support of HUMO, one of its maximum exponents, as an advisor.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/danielarocha.net\/foto"}

{"text":"This week, I simply recreated the chatroom I made a few weeks back using peer.js instead of socket.io. The difference now is that you have to call the other person\/people, but otherwise it works in the same way. Much more simple, but maybe less interesting?\nFor my midterm, I made a chat room that takes a picture of somebody else in the room whenever you submit a message. I built it off of the Face Chat from the other week.\nOne of the first things I added was a thing to tell you how many other people are currently in the room. I kept track of the client count in a variable in the server-side code, and added to it every time a new person joined the room. Once they disconnected, I removed a number, and I sent this updating number over to the client-side, which shows it on the page.\nIn order to take a picture of a different person in the room, I made an array of all the clients\u2019 socket IDs, and added someone\u2019s ID once they joined, and then removed them once they left.\nFrom there, I executed the picture-taking code, and added that photo to the text that the original user sent.\nThere were a couple other extra things I added in order to make the chat experience a little better, like the floating text box, and the auto-scrolling to the bottom of the page once new data is added.\nThere are still a lot of CSS related things I\u2019d want to change so that it looks better, but getting all my divs lined up properly is a task beyond me right now. I also want to add something that prevents people who don\u2019t allow a camera on the page to not be able to access the content.\nBuilding off of the chatroom I made the other week, I added a feature that takes a picture from your webcam once you submit your message, and posts them together.

Considering how much waste a busy restaurant can produce, recycling is not only the environmentally friendly option; it\u2019s significantly less expensive than paying for multiple waste pickups every week.\nAdditionally, restaurants tend to produce a lot of food waste that usually ends up in landfills. While food waste can\u2019t technically be \u201crecycled,\u201d a restaurant can implement proper food waste recycling programs to help minimize and manage it.\nIn addition to keeping these items out of the waste stream and landfill, recycling is more cost-effective than waste disposal fees, and a restaurant may even be able to make a small profit from recycling valuable materials like aluminum.\nWhile the restaurant does not see the direct impact of recycling long-term, they are ultimately helping to minimize environmental impact, decrease energy consumption, and reduce air and water pollution that would have resulted from manufacturing virgin materials instead of recycling.\nModify Portion Sizes or offer smaller portions for a discount if you notice a lot of unfinished meals returning to the kitchen.\nRecycle Used Cooking Oils. Partner with a rendering plant to recycle used cooking oils, greases and fats.\nComposting. Unless you\u2019re a small, family-owned, farm-to-table restaurant, you probably don\u2019t have a need to compost. However, there are almost always local farmers you can donate fruit and vegetable scraps to for composting in their fields. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll get paid for your garbage, but you can feel good knowing you\u2019re doing your part to keep food waste out of landfills.\nIf you\u2019re interested in implementing a recycling program in your Chicago area restaurant, contact CRI at 630-693-0111 for a free recycling audit. We\u2019ll analyze your waste stream and set up the recycling programs that you would benefit from most. If you\u2019re interested in proper food waste recycling practices, we can help you partner with local organizations that can help you manage and dispose of it to minimize your environmental impact.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.combinedresources.us\/restaurant-recycling-food-waste-management\/"}

{"text":"Scholars have defined the Qur\u2019an as \u201cthe words of Allah revealed to Muhammad (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him), the recitation of which is a form of worship.\u201d This definition can be applied to no other book or speech.\nA blessed Book which We have revealed to you [o Muhammad], that they might reflect upon its verses and that those of understanding would be reminded [Sad 38:29].\nShaykh al-Islam Ahmad bin Taymiyyah pointed out in his Fatawa that even the ordinary words of men are spoken or written for the purpose of being understood by the listener or reader and that the Qur\u2019an is surely more worthy of being understood than the words of men. Many scholars have stated that it is the responsibility of all Muslims to learn the Arabic language in order to understand the Qur\u2019an. Ibn Katheer, author of the well-known Arabic tafseer (explanation\/interpretation of the Qur\u2019an), maintained that it is also the duty of Muslim scholars to make its meanings known to the people.\nNo person can afford to be ignorant of the Qur\u2019an, for it is the constitution revealed by Allah to regulate and govern human life. It speaks with the perfect knowledge of the Creator about His creation. It exposes the truth and invites man to the way of truth. It contains important information about human destiny and that of the individual. It educates and raises men to the highest moral, intellectual and social level when they strive to comprehend it and apply its teachings to life.\nMoreover, it is the actual words of Allah \u2013 not created, but revealed by Him through the angel Gabriel to a human messenger, Muhammad bin Abdullah (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him), for the benefit of humanity. It is an eternal miracle given to the final prophet, Muhammad (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him), as proof of his prophethood and a challenge to all succeeding generations. It is of unique and inimitable quality. Revealed fourteen centuries ago, it remains today completely intact and unaltered in its original Arabic form.\nThen let them respond to Me and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided [Al-Baqarah 2:186].\nThe knowledge of Uloom al-Qur\u2019an, or \u2018The Sciences of the Qur\u2019an\u2019, deals with the knowledge of those sciences that have a direct bearing on the recitation, history, understanding and implementation of the Qur\u2019an. It is, therefore, a vast field of Islamic scholarship, and one that is of primary importance.\nThus, for example, with regards to recitation, uloom al-Qur\u2019an deals with the science of pronunciation (tajweed), the difference methodologies of reciting the Qur\u2019an (the qira\u2019aat), the blessings of reciting the Qur\u2019an, and the etiquette of its recitation.\nWith regards to the history of the Qur\u2019an, uloom al-Qur\u2019an deals with the stages of revelation of the Qur\u2019an, the compilation of the Qur\u2019an, the art and history of writing the Qur\u2019anic script (rasm al-masaahif), and the preservation of the Qur\u2019an.\nWith regards to its understanding and implementation, uloom al-Qur\u2019an covers the causes covers the causes of revelation (asbaab an-nuzool), the knowledge of the makkee and madanee revelations, the knowledge of the various forms (ahruf) it was revealed in, the understanding of its abrogated rulings and verses (naasikh wa al-mansookh), the knowledge of the various classifications of its verses (muhkam and mutashaabih, aam and khaas, mutlaq and muqqayad, etc.), the knowledge of the inimitable style of the Qur\u2019an (I\u2019jaaz al-Qur\u2019an), the knowledge of its interpretation (tafseer), the grammatical analysis of the Qur\u2019an (iraab al-Qur\u2019an) and the knowledge of those words whose usage has become uncommon over time (ghareeb al-Qur\u2019an).\nIt has been said that the knowledge of uloom al-Qur\u2019an is in reality the knowledge that one is required to know in order to properly interpret the Qur\u2019an. Therefore, to call this branch of Islamic knowledge \u2018The Procedure and Methodology of Interpretation\u2019 (Ilm Usool at-Tafseer) instead of \u2018uloom al Qur\u2019aan would not be far from the truth. However, uloom al-Qur\u2019an also includes topics that have very little or no bearing on tafseer, such as the compilation of the Qur\u2019an, and the development of the script of the Qur\u2019an. Therefore, the knowledge of uloom al-Qur\u2019an is more general than Ilm Usool at-Tafseer.\nThe compilation of the Qur\u2019an is a unique phenomenon that is peculiar to Islamic history, for no other religious book can claim to be anywhere near as authentic as the Qur\u2019an. The New Testament was authored over a century after Jesus\u2019s death, and the Old Testament\u2019s authors are shrouded in mystery, as are the authors of the Hindu scriptures. Only the Qur\u2019an can be claimed to have been preserved in its original form.\nThus, the earlier nations were given the responsibility of protecting their scriptures, in contrast to the Qur\u2019an, whose protection was the responsibility of the Creator.\nAn unbiased researcher, whether he believes in the prophethood of Muhammad (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) or not, must conclude that the Qur\u2019an that is present today is the same Qur\u2019an that the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) taught to his Companions. It therefore behooves Muslims when making such bold claims to investigate the history of its compilation, and examine the manner in which it was preserved.\nThere are three distinct stages of the compilation of the Qur\u2019an. The first is the preservation of the Qur\u2019an during the lifetime of the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him); the second, the compilation of the Qur\u2019an by Aboo Bakr; and the third, the compilation of Uthmaan.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/thethinkingmuslim.com\/2013\/04\/22\/studying-quran-tips-and-resources\/"}

You need to do plenty of research on the house and on how to purchase foreclosed homes. It amazes me that there is so much incorrect information on the Internet concerning the purchase, renovation and sale of foreclosed homes and foreclosure properties.\nSubmit the Request for Statement to be Eligible to Purchase Real Property at a Tax Sale ( Espa\u00f1ol ) and $10 fee.

The first thing involves inspecting the homes carefully by checking out both negligible and minor details.\nBuying homes from sheriff auction can help you to buy a home for under market value, but in most areas the bidding on these properties begins at two thirds of their appraised value. You can easily avail these homes when the public auctions are held by bidding the highest among all present. Part of what has caused the buyer\u2019s market is the increased number of bank owned homes in comparison to non-foreclosed homes. Buying a foreclosed property can be a complicated, but ultimately rewarding process in terms of getting more home for your purchasing power, stabilizing neighborhoods, and revitalizing communities.\nBuyers of foreclosed homes should also remember that these houses do not necessarily mean that it is empty already. When bidding it is always wise to start low to avoid overpricing the foreclosed homes. Foreclosed homes can vary from a regular home purchase, and you will want to research all loan products available for this type of transaction, including traditional loan products or an FHA 203(k) Renovation Loan (a mortgage that provides the purchase price plus funds for renovation by financing the as improved\u201d value of the home).

Every product I\u2019ve tried from them, I adore. I even used a selection of their products when I went away last year. The Elemis Deep Cleanse Facial Wash doesn\u2019t dissapoint, it\u2019s enriched with peppermint, which makes it incredibly refreshing. You\u2019d expect a deep cleansing face wash to strip your skin, but this one doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m currently finishing off a face wash from Clarins, but once that\u2019s done, I\u2019ll be switching it out for this one.\nI absolutely love Omorovicza, so much so, I already have this product in my skincare collection. The Refining Facial Polisher is like a gentle microdermabrasion at home. It\u2019s a bit of an intense exfoliator, so it\u2019s only suitable for use twice a week, but I love it. Whenever I use it, my skin feels incredibly smooth, I even feel like I could go without moisturising! I couldn\u2019t be happier to have another one of these, because I\u2019ve been trying to make my current one last as long as possible. Would recommend the Mankind Grooming Box for this product alone, as it retails for over \u00a360!\nOnce again, another product I already own! Regenerate have a cult following across the world, and once you try it, you\u2019ll know why. It has a scientific formula that actually helps to rebuild enamel, and it actually works. Not only that, but I feel like my teeth get whiter the more I use it. I do wish it had a stronger mint taste, but that\u2019s personal preference. It\u2019s still an amazing toothpaste!\nGuess what? I already own this product too! The Men-\u00dc D-Tox Clay Face Mask is a simple, yet effective, clay mask. It\u2019s pretty affordable, and is nice to use. It\u2019s not my favourite product, and I prefer the Omorovicza Moor Mud Mask. But if you\u2019re on a budget and want a face mask to remove impurities, this is the one for you.\nI\u2019ve not tried this product yet, because I\u2019ve been trialling a couple of other shave creams. But if my previous experiences with Anthony Skincare are anything to go by, it won\u2019t dissapoint. I love their glycolic face wash and wipes, so I\u2019m excited to give this a go.\nI love the scent of this shower gel. Korres never dissapoint when it comes to creating bodycare products that smell incredible. But unfortunately, my skin reacts to most of their products! Whenever I use the shower gels or body cream, my skin goes a bit red and feels irritated. I can get away with using their actual fragrances though, so that\u2019s always a winner!\nBesides the Korres Shower Gel, I\u2019ll be using every product from this Mankind Grooming Box. It\u2019s available for \u00a340 with a value over \u00a3100, so it\u2019s a pretty great deal.\nThey don\u2019t tend to be available for long, so get yours here now while stocks last!\nHave you bought a Mankind Grooming Box before? Let me know on Instagram.\nI was given this product to review, however all opinions are 100% honest and my own.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/hishabits.co.uk\/the-mankind-grooming-box-explorer-edit\/"}

{"text":"On the day following Guru Poornima 2011, the Bal Vikas children from Tamil Nadu staged a drama on the life of a grand old lady - the Avvaiyar. It was such an inspired and beautiful presentation that one felt Swami\u2019s presence throughout. Avvaiyar\u2019s childhood name is not known much and is actually not even relevant.\nBut here is a little girl so mad in her love for God (she loved the entire Divine family - Lord Shiva, Goddess Parvati and their sons, Lord Ganesha and Lord Muruga or Subramanya), that she decides to spend her entire life only for God. She refuses to get married but her mother tries to force her into entering family life. So she does a unique penance for Lord Ganesha and prays that she be turned into an old woman! That happens and suddenly nobody has the least interest in her! The mother laments and blesses her \u2018old\u2019 daughter to take up the path her heart desires.\nAs the scene played, another scene played in our hearts - Swami stressing that God is the only friend. Everyone in life comes to us only in order to get something of us and only God loves us selflessly. But what do we give Him from our side?\nThus seeing Avvaiyar make a sacrifice of her youth, life, wealth, progeny and everything in one go for God\u2019s sake was so inspiring and it brought a few tears in many eyes.\nOne more episode was almost startling in its profundity. Avvaiyar spends her entire life in teaching everyone about God. She inspires the simple-minded with her devotion and the intellectuals with her thought provoking poetry. Single-handedly she embodies the three paths of Karma (action), Bhakti (devotion) and Jnana (wisdom).\nWhen she raises her glance, she sees a child sitting on a branch.\n\u201cHot or cold?\u201d asks the child, quite firmly and looking away at the sky.\nThe lad laughs, shakes a branch gently and the fruits fall onto the ground. Avvaiyar picks up a fruit and blows away the sand before eating it.\nAvvaiyar looks at the child in amazement. All her life, she who has been a master of words; who played with words with alacrity; who took words and ordered them into texts to contain truth and the dharma and the ways of a just and beautiful life, now stands before a child humbled in a game of words. She sees the auspicious Divine child there - the Child of Beauty, the Child of Wisdom - Lord Muruga.\nAnd spontaneously she bursts forth in beautiful Tamil and in a mellifluous voice, \u201cPazham Neeyappa\u201d. In this poetic composition the opening term is a pun in Tamil - \u201cLord, You are the fruit of wisdom!\u201d and \u201cLord, grant me the fruit of wisdom!\u201d Her joy at seeing the Lord and anguish at not being able to recognize Him before are both beautifully depicted in this song.\nSwami often tells us that the name of the Lord is equal to the form of the Lord. Listening to His stories is equivalent to having His darshan. Our gratitude to these sweet Balvikas children for helping us see Swami on the beautiful evening following Guru Poornima.\nAnd for your pleasure, here is another song in that wonderful voice.","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/media.radiosai.org\/journals\/vol_09\/01JUL11\/10-PD_01.htm"}

{"text":"Learn From Gartner: What Are the Critical Capabilities for Your Contact Center?\nThe digital revolution has fueled an increase in customer expectations around customer service. Increasingly, customers expect to reach a business over the channel of their choice, any time of day or night. This has placed tremendous demands on the contact center to meet these expectations. In fact, today most contact centers support nine channels including email, chat, SMS, mobile apps, and oh yes, voice.\nAnd if there is one thing that is certain, it is that change is constant. So even if you feel your organization is able to handle the needs and expectations of today, you must also prepare for the uncertainty of tomorrow.\nMany contact center and IT leaders started with a voice-only contact center, and over time, added additional channels as needed. Often, this was done on an ad-hoc basis. More often than not, these channels were delivered by a number of disparate vendors.\nI don\u2019t need to tell you how difficult it is to integrate, update, and maintain point solutions from multiple vendors while seeking to deliver a consistent customer experience. Today\u2019s smart businesses recognize the need to modernize business processes and platforms to deliver an omnichannel customer experience. They realize that an open, scalable architecture for customer engagement increases operational and IT agility.\nSo my questions to you are: does your current contact center infrastructure provide you with a solution foundation to meet the needs of today and the challenges of tomorrow? How do you architect the contact center of tomorrow?\nLet\u2019s take a look at what Gartner has to say. As one of the world\u2019s leading information technology research and advisory companies, Gartner delivers the insight their clients need to make the best technology-related decisions.\nThis research paper is a companion to the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Contact Center Infrastructure \u2013 both papers help buyers understand the current state of the contact center industry.\nGenesys believes this comes in the form of an integrated customer experience platform that enables memorable, effortless customer experiences across all channels, touchpoints, and interactions. The key to this is the delivery of personalized, proactive inbound and outbound, omnichannel customer experiences. And to enable your team to succeed, you must send interactions and any resulting work items to the people with the right skills, at the right time, and via the channel selected by the customer.\nGartner recommends that organizations, \u201cplan for tighter integration of contact center infrastructure with customer self-service for a stronger customer engagement experience\u201d. Today, most routine inquiries are handled and resolved over a self-service channel. Yet, despite the explosive growth in the use of digital channels, voice remains an important channel as customers seek to talk to an expert for more complex issues. As a result, the ability to seamlessly transition from self- to assisted service, carrying forward context on what the customer was doing on the self-service channel, is critical \u2013 as is the ability to ensure that the customer is routed to the best available agent to address their specific needs.\nGartner states that \u201calthough suite solutions are mature enough for most customer service requirements, some legacy-constrained environments will continue to demand a best-of-breed approach.\u201d At Genesys, we believe in order to deliver on this, look to a vendor who has a history of openness. From its inception, we have been dedicated to delivering the flexibility inherent in open standard solutions, helping customers to consolidate systems and applications where possible while integrating with existing systems as necessary.\nThese points provide just a few valuable pieces of insight on the state of today\u2019s contact center infrastructure market.

{"text":"Who likes unwanted guest? And if excess fat be that unwanted guest, it\u2019s even more distressing! By the way, guests are temporary so why do you let excess fat own your body? When you let this happen, it\u2019s the beginning of a complete physical and mental torture. So, today let\u2019s talk elaborately about fat or weight loss.\nSo, brush aside all the lame excuses of time crunch, workload in the office, late night sleeping routine, etc. etc.\nAs and when you get up from your bed drink at least 1-1.5 l of water. If you want you can choose drinking the same amount of lukewarm water too. In no time, your body will be devoid of all the toxins and be completely cleansed from the inside. Make it your everyday ritual.\nAfter you\u2019re done with your morning green tea or lemon-honey solution, try to get some quality sunlight for good 10-15 minutes. Vitamin D from the sun rays makes our bones strong. By early morning we don\u2019t mean only at 5 or 6 a.m. for you can easily get a quality sun light till 9-10 a.m. This leaves little space for excuses. You don\u2019t have to skip your breakfast as this is the most important meal if you\u2019re wishing to lose weight. This is because, after a heavy breakfast we do not usually sit in our chairs or couches. Rather, we get going on our respective works. Hence, breakfast is easily digested by the body.\nWatch your calories: Do not eat blindly if you want to lose weight. Count your carbs and fats in every product that you eat for a week. Restrict from taking more fats and carbs because they are the main sources which make you fat.\nEat more proteins: Proteins build up your body in the needed proportions. unlike carbs and fats, proteins don\u2019t accumulate at few places. Instead, they help you maintain a good physique altogether.\nDrink more water: It keeps your metabolism active and helps you stay fresh, energetic and hydrated.\nEat slow: Eat without disturbances. Do not watch T.V., laptops, phones while eating. You should always eat slow without talking. If you really need some entertainment, you can play some nice music.\nLess stress, More success: Stay stress free. This will help not only in losing extra weight, but will also increase your productivity in every field.\nLimit sugar and refined carbs: Sugar kills body metabolism and increases body fat and weight. Our body requires a small amount of sugar per day. If you ever have a sugar rush, go for a spoonful of honey or some dates. All fruits have natural sugar, so opt them rather than the refined sugar.\nDairy and nuts: Nuts are rich in protein, dietary fibers and healthy nano- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, nuts are satiating foods that help you suppress your appetite.\nFinally, we\u2019ll suggest you take up some kind of physical activity. Whether you go for workout in the park or gym, or do yoga on your terrace or skip a rope or do crunches and planks inside your house, anything would suffice.\nOne thing you should keep a note of is that exercise or any aerobic activity on empty stomach fetch far better results for weight loss. Those who lift weights in the gym or at home must do your cardio workout AFTER your weight training. Don\u2019t do it in the starting. This is because our body is at the fasting stage or empty stomach stage after the weight training session as all the carbs (glucose) are used up.\nAlso, if someone is not able to exercise in the morning can do so in the evening. But, be consistent. Your body doesn\u2019t demand as much as you might be thinking. You only got to be a little more observant of your habits. Little changes can produce magnificent effect in toning up your beautiful body.","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/impulseluxury.com\/2018\/09\/12-best-and-easy-ways-to-lose-fat-with-our-helpful-tips-for-quick-results\/"}

{"text":"Our hands are our most precious and useful tools and too often we neglect to care for them. Most of us go through our day without even putting on any sort of hand cream or hand balm, leaving us with dry hands and irritated skin. This is even more problematic during winter months when there is very little moisture left in the air, which is why applying hand moisturizer should be part of everyone\u2019s daily routine. Kiehl\u2019s 165 years of skin care innovation have led to the development of the best hand cream that will leave your hands feeling constantly soft and hydrated. From salves, intensive treatments and liquid hand soaps, you are assured to find the perfect dry hands remedy. Also learn more about Kiehl\u2019s lip care line and sunscreen line to protect your skin and lips from exposure to the elements.\nHow to Get Rid of Callus on Hands?\nCalluses form when your skin hardens as a result of dry weather conditions or too much pressure on your skin. The most important step in treating callus, especially on hands, is moisturizing. Soak your hands in warm water for about ten minutes to soften your skin. Then apply one of our hand treatments to lock the moisture in to efficiently treat the skin condition. Gently rub a lotion and repeat this process to maintain your soft skin. Maintaining the use of a hand moisturizer and even carrying one around with you is a great way to prevent any future callus formation.\nWhat Causes Extremely Dry Hands?\nExtremely dry hands are a result of harsh weather conditions, rough work or exposure to chemicals like detergents. Prolonged exposure to water, especially hot water, can wash away the natural oils that protect your skin. The best way to avoid this is to apply moisturizer right after taking a shower when your skin is still damp. This will trap the moisture in your hand and rest of your body, and prevent them from drying out. Moisturizing, and rubbing the skin with lotion frequently is crucial to treat dry hands and avoid skin conditions such as calluses.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.kiehls.ca\/en\/body\/category\/hand-treatments\/"}

I've played some games, which can be a kind of time hole, but isn't always negative.\nMy adventures in the cyberpunk were interrupted. There were issues with the EPOC, which were initially based on 'it's not an EPOC', but later based on other things, like a table leg. I kid you not. My table leg is made of metal, and it is near the wireless dongle for the EPOC headset. This was a problem that a $4 2m USB extension cord from my local MSY has rendered resolved, but I did have to roam the forums for awhile before discovering that this might be a problem. I also downloaded the wrong software, which had nothing to do with the version of the headset, and everything to do with not trawling the forums to double check that the software did what one might argue was a reasonable assumption that it would do. In this case, that reasonable assumption being that it would receive signals form the hardware.\nIt is working now and I can play with it. Which is great. I'm not really sure where I am at with it, and I don't know what I really mean by that. It's there and it's working, but I've been really tired.

In that regard, I feel I am more than capable of fulfilling the duties of the Presidency as well as being an advisor, if necessary, to the reigning President.\nIn my opinion, growth and member retention are the most important isssues facing the leadership of AANR at this time. As owner of DeAnza Springs, one of the largest clubs in AANR, co-founder of Mira Vista in Tucson, and owner of a large portion of a small community in S. California, growth is my speciality. In my past career as vice-president of a major mortgage banking firm, I managed a multi branch operation and grew it into the largest and most profitable region in the Western Division. Also, over the last several Presidencies, the President has asked the Vice-President to become the Internal Affairs Chairman, if this trend continues, I have the experience of being the IA Chair of AANR West.","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/www.aanr.com\/blog\/2012-aanr-voters-guide-officers-vice-president-2\/"}

According to eMarketer, email marketing was the most effective digital marketing channel for customer retention in the United States in 2014. And BtoB Magazine reports that 59% of business-to-business marketers say email is the most effective channel for generating revenue.\nAnd yet, there\u2019s room for improvement. Below are some email marketing best practices.\nAre you planning your 2016 marketing and communications? Let\u2019s schedule a time to discuss how I could help you develop your marketing materials. Just call me at 240-803-3262.\nBest wishes for a very happy Thanksgiving, and a wonderful holiday season.\nP.S. The statistics about email marketing came from Hubspot's The Ultimate List of Marketing Statistics.\nWe all get tons of marketing emails, most of which we signed up for, or from organizations with which we have done a transaction. In other words, we\u2019ve opted-in and that makes us more likely to read the email or at least not unsubscribe. The opt-in is exactly what makes email marketing so valuable.\nBe careful about images. Did you know most email clients don\u2019t automatically download images? Often, emails will show up with an \"x\" where the image is supposed to be. This means that if all you send is an image with no text, the reader can\u2019t see anything at all. The solution is to use both text and images, and to use tags on the images.\nSee how your email renders on different platforms. Email can appear differently on different platforms and email services (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.) There are paid services like Email On Acid to show you how the email looks across platforms but you can and should test it yourself by sending it to different email addresses and accessing it from different devices (use friends if you have to!).\nMake sure it\u2019s readable on mobile devices. I receive countless emails that can\u2019t be easily read on my smartphone and this is a problem since Hubspot reports that more than 80% of readers are accessing email on mobile devices. Your email should be mobile-friendly. If it isn\u2019t, look into the coding or change email marketing providers.\nTest what you can and always check your statistics. If you have a large enough list, you can run tests. For example, you could check what subject lines increase open rates by sending one subject line to half your list and another subject to the other half. You could do the same type of test to check what day of the week gets a better response. Most email marketing platforms provide statistics, which allow you to see data such as open rates and click-throughs. Use the data to inform your next mailing.\nDo you have words and phrases that show up over and over in your writing or your speech? They are most likely your go-to adjectives, adverbs and descriptive phrases. The problem with using the same word or phrase multiple times is that it becomes boring or even meaningless to your reader or listener. Take the time to read or listen to your work carefully. What words or phrases are your crutches? It\u2019s easy to use clich\u00e9s or popular phrases (e.g., sweet spot, low hanging fruit, etc.). It may be harder to come up with an alternative, but doing so could add some zing to your communications.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/madmimi.com\/s\/987fe6"}

{"text":"Rent a Dumpster in Solano Now!\nSimply give us a call and we will answer any questions you may have about the Solano dumpster rental procedure, allowed materials, size you may need, etc.\nOur roll off containers can usually be delivered in Solano the day after you place your order. Make sure to call us early to ensure timely delivery.\nYou can fill your dumpster as full as you like, provided that you do not load it higher in relation to the sides of the container. Over-filling the dumpster could cause the waste or debris to slide off as the dumpster is loaded onto the truck or as the truck is driving. Overloaded or big-boned dumpsters are just not safe, and firms will not take unsafe loads as a way to protect motorists and passengers on the road.\nIn certain regions, dumpster loads must be tarped for safety. In case your load is too high, it WOn't be able to be tarped so you will need to remove some of the debris before it can be hauled away. This might result in extra fees if it demands you to keep the dumpster for a longer duration of time. Remember to keep your load no higher in relation to the sides of the dumpster, and you will be fine.\nRubbish removal vs dumpster rental in Solano - Which is right for you?\nFor those who own a project you are going to undertake at home, you may be wondering if it's better to hire someone to come haul off all your trash and junk for you, or in case you should only rent a dumpster in Solano and load it yourself.\nRenting a container is a better alternative in case you prefer the flexibility to load it on your own time and you also don't mind doing it yourself to save on job. Dumpsters also work nicely in the event that you have at least seven cubic yards or more of debris. Rolloffs usually begin at 10 cubic yards, so if you just have 3-4 yards of waste, you are paying for much more dumpster than you want.\nGarbage or junk removal makes more sense should you prefer somebody else to load your old stuff. Additionally, it functions nicely if you prefer it to be taken away quickly so it's out of your own hair or in the event that you only have a few large things; this is probably cheaper than renting a whole dumpster.\nWhat Size Dumpster Should I Get for a Residential Clean Out in Solano?\nResidential clean outs typically do not demand big dumpsters. The size that you simply need, however, will be contingent on the size of the endeavor.\nWhen choosing a dumpster, though, it is often advisable to request a size larger than what you think you'll need. Unless you are a professional, it is difficult to estimate the exact size required for your project. By getting a slightly larger size, you spend a bit more cash, but you also avoid the possibility that you will run out of room. Renting a larger dumpster is nearly always cheaper than renting two small ones.\nChoosing the best dumpster for your endeavor is an important aspect of dumpster rental in Solano. If you choose a dumpster that's too little, you won't have enough room for your debris and waste, which means you'll have to schedule extra trips. In the event you select one that's too large, you'll save time, but you'll waste money.\nIf you call a dumpster rental company in Solano and describe the job for which you desire a dumpster, they can advocate the finest size. Their years of experience mean that they often get it just about right. A 10-yard dumpster usually works well for moderate-sized clean-up projects and small remodeling jobs. A 20-yard dumpster is the best choice for big home clean-up projects and moderate-sized renovation projects, while a 30-yard dumpster has higher walls which are perfect for a home cleanout or remodeling jobs on a sizable house. 40-yard dumpsters are massively big and are used just on the biggest projects such as new construction.\nMost businesses ensure it is simple for you to book your dumpster appointment. Before you contact rental businesses to schedule a drop off or pick up, however, you can take a few steps which make the procedure even simpler.\n2. Give you and the rental company a lot of time. It is better to phone ahead at least a week or two before you want the dumpster. If you attempt to schedule an appointment earlier than that, you might have a small assortment.\n3. Keep in contact with the rental company. If anything changes in your program, contact the business as soon as possible to tell them. This way you can fix the appointment as needed without limiting your choices.\nMost dumpster rental firms in Solano commonly rent containers for a regular speed for 7 days, although most one-time customers end up keeping their container an average of three and a half days. When you call to allow the container, chat with the customer service representative about the duration of time you believe you'll need.\nIf it turns out that your project takes longer than you anticipated, only call the dumpster company to clarify. Most firms will charge you on a per-day basis after your initial 7 days. It is vital that you communicate this additional demand as soon as you understand you've it since most dumpster firms have a small number of bins that will already be allowed. Most firms will work together with you to accommodate your additional rental time. In case you believe you'll need the dumpster for an additional week or more, make sure to mention that; rates may change based on a longer time period.\n5. Find out what services you get with your dumpster rental in Solano.\nDumpster rentals are one of the most affordable ways to remove waste and debris from a dwelling or commercial property. Still, it is necessary that you consider your choices to make sure you get the very best price possible on your dumpster rental in Solano.\nAsking firms for price quotes is among the simplest ways to make sure you get a great deal. After talking to a number of businesses, you can compare the estimates to determine which one meets your needs at the bottom cost. When getting estimates, make sure that the firms contain all the services which you will desire. More than a few companies charge extra for services like drop off and pick up. They may also charge higher rates for removing specific types of materials. By having them contain all the fees in your quote, you can compare the prices accurately instead of getting mislead by a rental business that hides extra costs.\nThe amount of money that you spend renting a dumpster in Solano will depend on several variables.\nThe quantity of time that you need to keep the dumpster rental in Solano will also change the price. The more time you keep the dumpster, the further you can expect to pay.\nServices are another concern that could affect your total price. Many businesses comprise services like dumpster drop off and pick up in their costs. Some companies, however, fee for all these services. This makes it important that you ask about any hidden fees.\nWhen you rent a temporary dumpster, your goal is to fill it up and possess the waste hauled away. But should you prefer your waste recycled, you might have to go about it in a slightly different style. Waste in the majority of temporary dumpsters is not recycled as the containers are so large and carry so much material.\nIf you're interested in recycling any waste from your job, check into getting smaller containers. Many dumpster rental companies in Solano have a wide variety of containers available, including those for recycling. These are normally smaller than temporary dumpsters; they are the size of routine trash bins and smaller.\nShould you wish to recycle, learn whether the company you are working with uses single stream recycling (you do not need to sort the stuff) or in case you will need to organize the recyclable material into various containers (aluminum cans, cardboard, plastics, etc.) This can really make a difference in the variety of containers you have to rent.\nAll major credit cards accepted for dumpster rentals in Solano.","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/www.dumpsternm.com\/dumpster-rental\/solano\/"}
{"text":"Another one of those \u2018there\u2019s a good offer in the UK\u2019 blog posts, so the following might be of limited interest if you are not in the UK.\nMy first (and only) set of Copic markers is from the Nineties. Back then a friend told me about them and after hearing about their miraculous properties I really wanted to try them out. Back then, like today, they were not cheap. As far as I remember I paid around 20 Deutschmarks for each of them1. Well, they did and still do a nice job, but they usually bleed through the paper, maybe because they are alcohol based, so the reverse of the sheet of paper will look nearly as \u2018stained\u2019 as the front.\nThey certainly keep well over the years, my Copics all still work well. Just one of them had some of the \u2018ink\u2019 leak a bit into the cap, but that can be cleaned easily. If they ever dry out you can refill them.\nWhy did I mentioned them?\nWhen we went grocery shopping this weekend I saw that Aldi in the UK sells a whole pack of what looks like Copic copies for less than the price of one real Copic marker. It seems a good offer, but I can\u2019t comment on the quality of the pens.\n..and here a little bonus I found in the local Lego shop: Lego notebooks, reduced from \u00a310 to \u00a36. I assume the offers are similar in different Lego shops, but I can\u2019t be sure.\nIn case you wonder, I bought neither the Copic copies, not the Lego notebook.\nYou might have noticed that it\u2019s been very quiet here on Bleistift. That\u2019s not because I lost interest in pencils, but because my job has been keeping me more than busy. Just in case you wonder \u2013 no: I didn\u2019t change jobs and didn\u2019t get promoted. In the past, there were up to fifteen blog posts a month, but for now, probably up to and including January there won\u2019t be many blog posts. I might also have to suspend the Pencil Pot of the Month series for now. A shame as it has been running continuously for exactly 24 months \u2013 the two years from October 2015 until September 2017. I will, however, try to give occasional life signs every now and then, like I do today, until blogging can resume again as usual.\nSince we\u2019re talking about the Pencil Pot of the Month: the one from August 2016 was from the Danish chain \u2018Tiger\u20191 which has a shop in the city where I live. The last purchase I made there was Tiger\u2019s version of the Blackwing pencil.\nIn today\u2019s \u2018life sign\u2019 I want to talk about this new Blackwing copy. If you read pencil blogs, and if you are here you do, the Blackwing probably doesn\u2019t need any introduction. CalCedar\u2019s remake of the Blackwing doesn\u2019t need any introduction either. Well, now it\u2019s not the only remake anymore. As mentioned aboveTiger, also known as Flying Tiger Copenhagen, introduced one, too.\nIn the introduction I wrote that I am quite busy, so am not following what\u2019s going on in the pencil fandom (with very few exceptions). That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t know that there seems to be some controversy going on about the new Danish Blackwing remake. I was told that apparently, some CalCedar\/Palomino Blackwing fanboys are pretty upset about there being a copy of the Blackwing. I don\u2019t know what arguments have been made or where they have been made, but here are my initial thoughts after having used the Danish Blackwing for a while.\nWe could start by talking about the Ship of Theseus and what makes the CalCedar Blackwing2 a descendant of the original, but in reality I don\u2019t see much of a link.\nWell, what happened is: the Theseus sunk. Somebody else registered another ship under the same name.\nHere\u2019s why. There used to be a pencil called Blackwing. The company behind it stopped making this pencil. The owner of the trademark didn\u2019t renew the trademark so it lapsed. An unrelated company took the trademark and manufactured a similar looking pencil, the main similarity being the characteristic ferrule. The lead recipe is different. It\u2019s made in a completely different country. There is no continuity, nothing that links the original and the remake except the name ..and with me being German I am automatically reminded of the German saying \u201cnames are but noise and smoke\u201d3.\nThe Theseus example doesn\u2019t apply because the original Theseus sunk. There\u2019s a new Theseus. There\u2019s a new Blackwing. In the end York and New York have more of a link4 than the Blackwing and the new Blackwing.\nMy point here is: don\u2019t complain that Tiger\u2019s pencil is a copy of the Blackwing. The new Blackwing from CalCedar\/Palomino is itself only a copy with no link to the original.\nWhat CalCedar did do is bring a pencil (that was previously mainly known to pencileers, molyvophiles5 and molyvologues6 through anecdotes and the odd poem) to the mass market. In my 2010 blog post I wrote that the new Blackwing might become the new Moleskine. With its price tag I think it must have an even higher profit margin than a Moleskine \u2013 and like the Moleskine you can now buy the new Blackwing on the high street in the UK. Something the original Blackwing never achieved. I guess that\u2019s the power of marketing \u2013 you create a link to something greater in people\u2019s mind and make it a Veblen good. People who wouldn\u2019t have bought 3B, 4B, 5B pencils in the past are happy to pay a premium and because of the characteristic ferrule it\u2019s easy to show off that it\u2019s a posh pencil.\nWith that in mind, I think the Danish Blackwing is as much a modern Blackwing as the CalCedar one. Actually, I like it even more than the CalCedar remake, because it actually keeps the point. Something I don\u2019t like about the Palomino Blackwing, as explained earlier. If you write small with Tiger\u2019s Blackwing you don\u2019t have to sharpen it every few words often. Ok, the wood on the Danish7 one doesn\u2019t look as good, but I can buy 4 for \u00a31, so 12 are \u00a33, whereas 12 CalCedar ones are \u00a329.95 in the UK, nearly exactly ten times as expensive. For such a price difference I take the one that keeps the point ..and is therefore usable for my purposes8 any day.\nPS: What a shame that Tiger didn\u2019t put 602 in the item or barcode number, then I could have referred to the Tiger Blackwing as a 602.\nIf you want to find out more about the Blackwing and its history visit the Blackwing Pages.\nThere were a few great blog posts about Faber-Castell\u2019s Perfect Pencil on Sean\u2019s (retired) Pencils and Music blog and the (also retired) Pencil Talk blog had a whole series of blog posts about the different versions.\nI have used Faber-Castell\u2019s Perfect Pencil for quite a few years now and have mentioned it a few times on this blog, but I thought the blog posts I have don\u2019t pay adequate tribute to this great pencil, so here is a closer look (I don\u2019t dare to call it a review) at the cheapest version available.\nOfficially called the Perfect Pencil II, but sometimes called the Perfect Pencil junior (for example at Cult Pens while The Journal Shop calls it Perfect Pencil II) this pencil was released in 2007. There are different colours available (blue, red, black, blackberry \u2013 the article number starts with 18 29, followed by another number for the colour) and this pencil can be bought for \u00a33 (~$3.95; \u20ac3.55) or less. I bought mine in Shanghai and I think I paid the equivalent of \u00a32 or less.\nand it features a built-in sharpener.\nIt is best to be used with eraser tipped pencils and official refills are shorter than normal so that the perfect pencil fits in shirt pockets etc.\nIt\u2019s not bad looking, but for my taste the Castell version is much better looking ..and less bulky, but also a few times more expensive, so more of a problem when you lose it (I lost mine after a few years of use).\nThe first perfect pencil, the brainchild of Anton-Wolfgang Graf von Faber-Castell, was part of the Graf von Faber-Castell line and came out in 1993. Back then the eraser was in the extender.\n1997 Faber-Castell released more affordable perfect pencils (the Castell and Design versions are still available) and a year later the posh Graf von Faber-Castell perfect pencil changed to the more familiar version with the eraser under a small cap.\nHere\u2019s a video where I look at the Perfect Pencil II.\nI suggest you click on it to open it in YouTube, you then get a higher resolution and you can play it with a higher speed on most devices (I like 1.5x). This video also looks at how products in China are marked (origin and date) and shows Shangching\u2018s Tomoe River notebook I use for diagrams in this blog.\nOther manufacturers have released similar products.\nHave a look at the Pencil Revolution\u2019s review of Staedtler\u2019s The Pencil and the KUM Tip-Top Pop Pencil.\nIf you want to move up to a more expensive version I recommend the Castell version, which can be bought for under \u00a310 (~$13.15; \u20ac11.80). I have previously looked at the black edition of the Castell Perfect Pencil.\nThere is also the more direct successor available, the Perfect Pencil III, bulkier, but with a built-in waste box. The cheapest seller I found in the UK so far is the Journal Shop where it sells for \u00a33.95.\nJohn the Monkey compared the Perfect Pencil II and the Castell version.\nLung Sketching Scrolls had a look at the Fun version seen in the image of the brochure above.\nPens! Paper! Pencils had a look at the Castell version.\nEconomy Pens had a look at the Castell version.\nThe Well-Appointed Desk had a look at the Perfect Pencil II.\nAs usual: please open the images in a a new tab to see the high-res version.\nI would like to thank Faber-Castell\u2019s Edith Luther for the additional information she has provided.\nWhat an exciting day. I got two deliveries, one from Japan and one from Germany.\nThe parcel from Japan was sent from Yumiko, a friend of Sean, who helped me get a few things I couldn\u2019t order myself \u2026including Uniqlo\u2019s Tombow t-shirts. I was able to get the Pelikan version here in Europe, but the Tombow version is not being sold here.\nI was hoping that the Japanese XL will be similar in size to the European XL, especially since the t-shirts being sold here come with English\/Japanese tags, but unfortunately it turned out that the Japanese XL is at least one size smaller than the European version \u2013 so the t-shirts won\u2019t fit unless I lose a lot of weight. I guess I should see this as my incentive to lose more weight ..but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s achievable for me to fit into these anytime soon.\nThere was also something else in the parcel. Something very special.\nNot as posh as the ones shown on Contrapuntalism, but nevertheless extremely nice. Lexikaliker had similar ones, too.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the replacement Pollux.\nAs a comparison: the second video features a knife sharpened pencil. You can also see Staedtler\u2019s sand paper in the second video.\nLexikaliker has a blog post about the unsharpened Mars Lumograph pencils.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/bleistift.blog\/tag\/made-in-china\/"}
{"text":"Uber Technologies claimed on Wednesday that its ride-sharing mobile app runs legitimately in South Korea and benefits consumers and drivers, in response to efforts by the city of Seoul\u2019s to ban the service in July for violations of local taxi regulations.\nUnder the current law, people who solicit a ride using a private or rented car could be sentenced up to two years in jail or fined 20,000,000 won (about US$19,000). In April the city fined a driver 1 million won for providing an Uber ride using a rented car. The city additionally criticized the ride-hailing service for lacking proper background checks of drivers and failing to provide appropriate insurance for users in case of accidents.\nBut at a media briefing in Seoul on Wednesday the head of Uber\u2019s Asia business, Allen Penn, said the company only partners with licensed companies and drivers, and is only a technology platform that matches rides with end users.\n\u201cWe see this type of discussion around the world. The regulations are outdated. The regulations have existed since long before we began carrying around smartphones in our pockets,\u201d Penn said. Uber is willing to have a conversation on how to better structure the regulations in technology-driven world, which should be pro-innovation, pro-business and pro-competition, he said.\nUber launched in Seoul last August, offering its on-demand ride service UberBLACK, with premium black cars such as the Hyundai Equus, Mercedes S or E Class, or BMW 7 series. Regular cab fares there usually start at 3,000 won (about $2.90) and the premium vehicles at 4,500 won, whereas Uber starts at 5,000 won.\nDespite the price tag, Uber has attracted regular users in Seoul with its simple steps for users from finding a cab to making payment. The transaction is cashless, with a pre-authorized credit card. Beyond convenience, the company boasts about its safety service by providing driver\u2019s ID and vehicle\u2019s number as well as a rating system.\nThe Silicon Valley company also argued that it has benefitted the drivers and ultimately cities globally. Just a month after the launch in Seoul, the service lifted the drivers\u2019 income up to 40 percent a month, the company said in a statement.\nOn the other hand, it triggered a backlash from the existing taxi business by adding competition in an already saturated taxi market in Korea.\nProtests have already taken place across Europe in cities including London, Berlin, Paris and Madrid. Berlin and Brussels courts have banned the riding app in April.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/2462020\/uber-defends-its-ridesharing-platform-as-seoul-plans-to-ban-it.html"}
{"text":"Introduction: Most studies of drowning in Bangladeshi populations to date have described mortality and trends. We sought to identify associations between socioeconomic status and child-care practices and nonfatal drowning in rural Bangladeshi children. Materials and Methods: This community-based case-control study was conducted in rural children aged 1-5 years in Raiganj subdistrict of Bangladesh. 122 cases and 134 age-matched controls were recruited and their mothers were interviewed by use of a structured questionnaire. Univariate analyses and logistic regression were done to analyse the data. Results: Child nonfatal drowning was significantly associated with mothers: With low educational status (P < 0.001), of younger age (P < 0.005), of single status (P < 0.001) and with more than three children (P < 0.001). Nonfatal drowning was 12 and five times more likely in children of illiterate mothers than in children of mothers with academic knowledge equivalent to sixth to tenth grade (OR [95% CI] 0.08 [0.02-0.26]) and above tenth grade (OR [95% CI] 0.21 [0.04-0.95]) (P < 0.001), respectively. Low socioeconomic status, indicated by lower family expenditure (P < 0.001) and no house (P < 0.05; OR [95% CI] 0.58 [0.17-0.99]), were found to be risk factors for childhood nonfatal drowning. Improved child care, as measured by a child-care index, was associated with significantly lower non-fatal drowning (P < 0.001). Child care improved with higher educational attainment of mothers (P < 0.005) and increased socioeconomic status. Nonfatal drowning was more common when the main caregiver was not the mother (P < 0.001). Forward likelihood ratio logistic regression indicated mothers' lower educational status as the best predictor of nonfatal drowning. Conclusion: Better child care and prevention of nonfatal drowning might be ensured through increasing mothers' educational attainment and improvements in socioeconomic status.","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/www.who-seajph.org\/article.asp?issn=2224-3151;year=2013;volume=2;issue=2;spage=88;epage=95;aulast=Abdullah;type=0"}

{"text":"The end of each year is often a time for reflection, as we look back on the year that was before we get ready to turn the page on a brand new year. When it comes to the movies, there\u2019s more than enough to reflect on, with countless amounts of \u201chot takes\u201d starting to surface, including lists of the top 10 movies, but this year, we thought we\u2019d try a different approach as well. Given how unique a year 2017 was at the box office, we decided to delve back through the year that was, and pick out the top 10 most interesting trends that developed among audiences this year, some of which could have quite the big impact on the movie industry for many years to come.\nWhile the top 10 for this year isn\u2019t officially set in stone yet, since it\u2019s only a matter of time before Star Wars: The Last Jedi vaults to the top of the charts, overtaking the top-grossing movie for roughly three-quarters of this year, Disney\u2019s Beauty and the Beast, which has a taken in $504 milion domestic and became the first movie of 2017 to cross $1 billion worldwide, with global total of $1.26 billion. Star Wars: The Last Jedi should have no trouble surpassing both of those tallies on both the foreign and domestic front, although it will still come far shy of breaking all of the record set by 2015\u2019s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the first Star Wars movie to hit theaters in 10 years, including the highest opening weekend ($247.9 million) and all time domestic gross ($936.6 million).\nWith all of that being said, we\u2019re going all the way back to examine the entire year from top to bottom, and compare it with trends that have been set forth several years prior. We\u2019ll examine trends in everything from superhero movies to animated movies, sequels, remakes, reboots and everything in between, including, *gasp* original movies! We kick off this top 10 list with a trend that was bucked in a rather huge way this year, with one notable exception, so sit back and relax and enjoy this trip through the year that was 2017 at the box office.\nAs of right now, there are two R-rated movies in the domestic top 10, the IT remake (#5, $327.4 million) and Logan (#8, $226.2 million). If Logan can hang on and stay in the top 10 when all is said and done (which it should be able to do), 2017 will mark the first year since 2003 that there have been two R-rated movies in the top 10 at the box office. That particular year, there was actually three, with The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, and aside from The Hangover trilogy, most of the R-rated hits in the 14 years since have been one-off anomalies, like The Passion of the Christ, American Sniper and Ted. The massive success of both IT and Logan, along with other hits like Get Out ($174.4 million), Split ($138.1 million), Girls Trip ($115.1 million), Fifty Shades Darker ($114.4 million), Baby Driver ($107.8 million), Annabelle: Creation ($102 million) and Kingsman: The Golden Circle ($100.1 million) all surpassed $100 million at the domestic box office. Last year, only three R-rated movies crossed $100 million, Deadpool ($363 million), Bad Moms ($113.2 million) and The Conjuring 2 ($103.2 million) crossed the $100 million mark, so there shouldn\u2019t be any doubt that R-rated movies are back in a huge way at the box office.\nWhile January and February aren\u2019t often home to buzzworthy box office hits, two of the most talked-about movies this year debuted in this months and raked in big bucks on tiny budgets. Director M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s hit Split took in $138.1 million domestic and $278.3 million worldwide from just a $9 million production budget. Jordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut Get Out earned $174.4 million domestic and $254.3 million worldwide, from just a $4.5 million budget. Get Out has been deemed the most profitable film of 2017, with Split not too far behind, which makes sense since both films produced by low-budget specialist Jason Blum. While the top 10 is still dominated by big budget fare, New Line\u2019s IT has taken in $327.4 million domestic and $697.5 million from just a $35 million budget. Aside from Despicable Me 3, which had an $80 million budget, the rest of the top to movies were budgeted far over $100 million apiece. Movies like Girls Trip ($139 million worldwide, $19 million budget), Baby Driver ($226.9 million worldwide, $34 million budget) and Annabelle: Creation ($306 million worldwide, $15 million budget) managed to fare quite well without breaking the bank, so it\u2019s certainly possible that we could see more low-budget fare hit theaters, especially considering what happened to many of the big-budget summer sequels and reboots.\nOf the current top 10 movies, four were released in the summer months, the same amount as last year, and despite this year\u2019s box office woes towards the end of the summer, there were still some big summer hits. Wonder Woman (#2, $412.5 million), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (#3, $389.8 million), Spider-Man: Homecoming (#4, $334.2 million) and Despicable Me 3 (#7, $264.5 million) were the biggest hits of the summer, which certainly didn\u2019t as a surprise to any box office analysts, since they\u2019re all either sequels or based on popular brands. The big surprise, however, was that so many other projects that have thrived at the box office in the past, have fallen off so sharply. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales ($172.5 million), Cars 3, ($152.9 million), War For the Planet of the Apes ($146.8 million), Transformers: The Last Knight ($130.1 million) and Resident Evil: The Final Chapter ($26.8 million) all posted franchise-low domestic grosses this year, while high-powered movies based on hit franchises like Power Rangers ($85.3 million), The Mummy ($80.1 million), Alien: Covenant ($74.2 million) and Baywatch ($58 million}, The Dark Tower ($50.7 million), Rings ($27.9 million), CHiPs ($18.6 million) and Flatliners ($16.7 million) all failed to make a huge dent at the box office as well.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/gadgetgreed.com\/what-we-learned-from-the-2017-box-office\/"}

In my work as a Research Assistant, I am focussed on the Policy work-stream, analysing the existing policy framework and proposed revisions around digital surveillance.\nMyself and two co-applicants won funding from innovation charity Nesta\u2019s Bright Ideas research fund for this project. We will research the varied use of open government data by civil society groups around the world, and investigate how this relates to wider political and cultural factors.\nAs part of my research work at the Oxford Internet Institute I assist with this Sloan Foundation-funded project, investigating the innovative and pioneering ways in which big data sources are being used for academic research and policy making.\nIn partnership with the British Library and the Institute of Historical Research, this AHRC-funded project, on which I serve as research assistant, investigates how web archives can be used as an emerging source of big data for academic research.\nAs part of my work as a Campaign Fellow on the Obama for America campaign in 2012, I led the development of grassroots support in the city of Goffstown, New Hampshire. This involved reaching out to new and existing supporters and staging local events and activities to grow the campaign from the ground up.\nWhilst working for London-based tech firm Eproductive, I managed the development and rollout of stakeholder networking software for leading UK charity Save the Children. This involved liaising with developers and the client to create a cutting-edge platform for the sharing of news, tools, media and other resources between various stakeholders within the organisation.\nBetween 2011 and 2012 I served as Sub-editor and then Culture Editor of The Vibe, an online news site led by and aimed at students and young people. I commissioned, proofread and prepared contributions for publication on the website.\nAs part of research for my undergraduate dissertation, I developed an online questionnaire designed to test a participant\u2019s ideology on three dimensions of policy: economic, social and foreign. The questionnaire is still live and active.\nDuring the 2010 general election I worked as a regional organiser for the political campaign Power2010. The group advocated electoral and constitutional reform, and my work involved organising events in local towns, securing signatures from the public and engaging with parliamentary candidates.\nAt the age of 16 I came up with the idea for a website which promoted efforts to mitigate climate change using a geographic interface.

{"text":"Spending time together as a family is important. It helps to nurture close relationships that last from childhood through the adult years. Sometimes, though, we can get into the habit of existing around one another without spending any actual quality time together.\nScreen time. It's become the villain of family life, but is it all bad? Today, we all have so many options when it comes to sneaking away\u2014alone\u2014with some kind of screen-based device for company, be it a smart phone, tablet, games console or TV in our bedroom, complete with Netflix subscription. Screen time can be isolating. At the very least, it can mean socialising without actually leaving the confines of a room, or being with anyone at all in the flesh.\nBut I remember many an evening sitting with my family watching TV. It might sound like a lazy way to spend time together, but it definitely brought us together. With only one TV in the house, and no other form of 'easy' entertainment with the exception of music, we all watched TV and we often watched the same shows. Top of the Pops, on a Thursday evening, was a favourite.\nOne way to spend more time together as a family is to watch something together, in the same room, at the same time. It's cosy, particularly in the colder months. Watch a movie, begin a box set, or just choose something regular that everyone will like.\nOr, if you are happy to spend the money, go to the cinema. If you can afford it, make it a regular outing - say, once per month. I hardly ever go to the cinema, but it was my birthday recently and I took my children (aged 10 and 18) to watch Bohemian Rhapsody, the new Queen biopic. It was my birthday, so my choice, I figured. I didn't know what they would think, particularly my youngest. Even as we were watching it, I was thinking to myself that he's probably not enjoying it; it's too old for him and maybe too dated. Afterwards, he said it was brilliant, much better than he'd thought it would be. We've all been playing Queen around the house ever since - proof that watching something together can lead to bonding in other ways, as well!\nBoard games bond families. As a child, I recall many weekend evenings spent together around the table, playing a game of some description. There was talking, laughing, excitement over winning - in fact, family board games have left me with that kind of cosy, simple memory that is the very fabrication of a happy childhood.\nPerhaps it seems as though your older children aren't interested anymore, but it might just be that you're not playing the right game or that you haven't even asked them. My teenager loves games, but not ones that rely on luck to win. He likes games of strategy, or anything that allows him to show off his general knowledge or skills, such as Trivial Pursuit or Chess. Yahtzee is another favourite, and it's a great choice because it's so quick. It's a personal choice, but as long as everyone is happy then it's positive time spent nurturing bonds.\nEven if you don't feel like playing a game, or you're busy doing something else, it's important to make the time anyway. Just half an hour of quality time spent with your family can bring everyone closer together. Chores can wait - dust off the board and do it!\nTo make it even more of an event, prepare some favourite snack food to put on the table alongside the game. Perhaps some popcorn, or just bowls of nibbles. Making it a regular event will help to strengthen your bonds as a family unit.\nWell, the idea is that children eventually grow up and move out, so that's not completely realistic - but there is an awful lot to say for the role of a shared activity when it comes to maintaining close family bonds as your family grows up.\n'Going somewhere together' presents endless options. It could be a full day out, or something as simple as a walk along a beach for an hour, skimming stones (something I used to love as a child, plus it's free). You could visit a museum, go bowling, visit another city, play mini golf, walk through woods, go on a family bike ride, or anything else that appeals.\nGoing somewhere together can really help to improve communication with family members, since you'll all be sharing the same experience. It allows conversation to arise naturally, since everyone's focus is on the same thing, without distractions from home. And it doesn't have to cost a lot, or anything at all. There are options for all budgets.\nAnd if you're feeling adventurous, how about trying a completely new activity together? What you choose will depend on your individual interests, but ideas could include climbing, geocaching, skating, canoeing, archery or anything else that takes your fancy.\nIn many countries, eating together is an integral part of family life. Regular, shared meals offer the chance of relaxed conversation; a chance to catch up with everyone. Sometimes, modern life and working commitments mean that everyone is in a rush and has different time commitments, but gathering round the table as much as possible is an important way to bond. I find this to be even more important as children hit the later teen years, as they tend to like their own space at that stage, meaning that the meal table may be your only chance in which to be in the same place at the same time, for more than five minutes.\nMake mealtimes into a ritual in which everyone participates. Get the children to lay the table. Light a centrepiece candle. Turn the television off and ban any phones. Talk about everyone's respective day, or anything else they want to discuss, and remember that listening is as important as talking.\nEat together as often as you can - I work three nights of the week, meaning that those nights are very 'rushed', but the other four nights (and especially on Sunday), I try to adhere to the rule of eating properly, together.\nIt's not everyone's cup of tea, but there's nothing quite like camping to force your family to spend real time together. Camping is all about making your own fun - with little else in the form of distraction, it's a good, back-to-basics winner - with plenty of healthy fresh air thrown in. In fact, camping is the extreme version of the other suggested activities, because you all have little choice but to cook, eat, play and converse with one another, for the entire duration of the trip. And that's a good thing, because time spent as a family unit, away from work responsibilities, household chores and isolating technology is quality time.\nMy son wants to build a cabinet. Personally, I know very little about building cabinets, other than some wood and various tools are required. We don't actually have the tools, either, so we are probably not yet in a position to make the cabinet. However, his enthusiasm for the project is very refreshing, especially since he spends most of his time at home cocooned in his room.\nMaking something together is the perfect team-building exercise. Many companies and establishments go to great efforts to arrange team-building activities in order to foster an environment in which people work better together. Making something as a family is a great way to bond; it is fun and rewarding. Just make sure that everyone gets the chance to participate somehow.\nTwo ideas for a family project are a bird box, which is a fairly simple wood work project that can be painted afterwards, and a vegetable box, which can be an ongoing project in that in can be used indefinitely to grow and harvest food. Alternatively, you could create a 'den' out of wood for younger children, or just something random, like the robot pictured below.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/wehavekids.com\/parenting\/How-to-Spend-More-Time-With-Your-Family"}
{"text":"Problem: The customer came to us with condensation on the ductwork in his crawl space. After further examination, mold was discovered in the crawl space as well.\nSolution: In order to solve this problem, our technicians used hepa vacuums to remove loose mold spores. Next they applied a non-toxic and hydrogen forming cleanser to remove the mold. Lastly, a mold stain remover was used to remove any pigment staining that was left behind by the mold. In order to keep the moisture out of the crawl space, our technicians encapsulated it by adding a liner to the walls and installing drain fabric on the floor. The great part about this is that it will help diffuse soil gases, such as radon and can help reflect heat from the crawl space. The encapsulation will also keep out bugs and any moisture that could cause mold!\nProblem: The previous tenants smoked inside the house for a couple of years. The owner listed the house for sale and after cleaning everything including the carpets a strong odor remained. The smell was objectionable to prospective buyers. They we at a loss to solve the problem.\nSolution: The realtor contacted us after hearing about a new service we were offering. We treated the house with a chlorine dioxide vapor for 12 hours. The odor was permanently removed and smells clean and fresh.\nProblem: They owners complained of musty odors and cold floors.\nSolution: Spray foam insulation was used to seal the perimeter rim joist and sill. We removed the old vapor barrier and installed a sealed 12 mil floor and wall liner.\nProblem: An area inside the customer\u2019s home was created to store guns. The room was encased with concrete walls and ceilings. Because concrete constantly gives off moisture, the room had very high humidity combined with the fact that there was no ventilation in the room at all. This resulted in dozens of firearms becoming contaminated with mold.\nSolution: All firearms in the room were removed, cleaned, and put back in storage after the room was cleaned itself. However, the mold was just a symptom of a much larger issue, moisture. In this case, all that was needed was to install a high capacity dehumidifier in the room. The room is now at a stable humidity level and free of mold growth.\nAnything that stood out on this project: Obviously, the time spent cleaning the firearms was a unique project. We disassembled and cleaned everything from modern pistols to antique rifles, saving the customer tens of thousands of dollars. The most challenging part of the project was removing the stocks from some of the antique rifles. Most of them were fragile, so we had to be extremely careful not to damage them.\nProblem: The filters in the HVAC system in every apartment of the facility were removed, causing the A-coil to clog and not dehumidifier them air. This resulted in humidity levels of 90% in a couple of rooms! All the tenants\u2019 belongings were contaminated with mold.\nSolution: The HVAC contractor removed and cleaned all the A-coils, then re installed the filters. Our portion of the project was to clean the rooms and the tenants\u2019 belongings. This was a project that was on a very tight schedule. We knew how important it was to get the job done on time and to get it right the first time. We passed clearance testing on the first attempt, saving the customer money and time.\nAnything that stood out on this project: Seeing the amount of damage that can be caused by the HVAC system not running properly was stunning. This project needed a high amount of attention to detail. Cleaning things that belong to people is something that should always be taken seriously.\nSolution: We performed air duct cleaning throughout the entire space. Removing grease and flour from the ducts, supply grills, return grills, and air handler units. This allowed the system to run at full efficiency and provide cleaner air for their customers.\nAnything that stood out on this project: Not too much of a surprise with this project, the amount of flour removed from the system was significant. Air duct cleaning will provide customers with clean air!\nProblem: Water was seeping into the basement through floor and wall cracks.\nSolution: Install an interior full perimeter drainage system in the basement and repair the wall cracks with an epoxy injection.\nAnything that stood out on this project: The homeowner attempted to solve the issue with paint and exterior drainage without success. The AdvantaDrain system solved the issue for good.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.advantaclean.com\/collinsville-il\/why-advantaclean-\/our-case-studies\/"}

But what hasn\u2019t been known is the extent that young adults drive while smart-phoning.\nSo researchers at Harvard Medical School and The Massachusetts Ear and Eye Infirmary set out to find out. They called the tool they built to study this the Distracted Driving Survey (DDS) and score. The recent article, \u201cTexting while driving, the development and validation of the distracted driving survey and risk score among young adults,\u201d by Regan W. Bergmark, Emily Gliklich, Rong Guo, and Richard E. Gliklich published in Injury Epidemiology details how they developed a self-administered survey, and the results they got from young adults in the 18-24 age bracket.\nThe survey they developed has 11 questions and takes 2-4 minutes to complete. They administered the survey to young drivers from the greater Boston metro area, and from the Western and Eastern U.S. They used these responses to develop a statistical scoring system. As they write, \u201cThe DDS is intended to be used to assess behavior patterns and risk and to evaluate the impact of public health interventions aimed at reducing texting and other cell phone-related distracted driving behaviors.\u201d They intend this tool to be used to gather more data, the analysis of which they hope can point the way towards effective anti-distraction interventions.\nHi, you have given the best article about texting while driving technology and also in a right way thanks for posting such useful article, thanks a lot.","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/blogs.springeropen.com\/springeropen\/2016\/03\/10\/texting-driving-young-adults\/"}

{"text":"We cottage photographers are self-involved, just like the rest of humanity. Where does the madness end?\nIn the depths of winter, I often go scuba diving in warmer parts of the world. I\u2019m no expert, but I have been at it long enough to remember when underwater cameras were exotic rarities. Back then, those cameras and their watertight housings were super-expensive pieces of gear that only professionals or dedicated amateurs possessed. They were also big and bulky, with lots of fiddly buttons, so underwater photographers tended to be highly skilled divers, able to swim and navigate single-handedly while controlling buoyancy and positioning so as not to ruin photos, knock chunks off a reef, or kick me in the face.\nNowadays, even first-time divers who struggle with the basics bring a cheap waterproof camera or a GoPro. Mostly, they flail around madly and take as many pictures as possible. The newbs focus on selfies, fleeing turtles, and shots of their buddy who is enthusiastically wagging double hang-tens as he crushes a giant sponge. Such is the price of progress.\nBack in cottage country, the situation is no different. In the olden days when I helped cull entries to the Cottage Life Photo Contest, cameras used \u201cfilm,\u201d and photography was awful. After sorting through thousands of pictures, many of them actually out of focus, it occurred to me that cottage photographers are obsessed with three image types: the sunset picture. The chipmunk picture. The dog on dock picture. And while today\u2019s digital cameras can guarantee that our photos are in focus, they can\u2019t change one immutable fact: the sunset- chipmunk-dog cottage triptych is still painfully boring.\nBut I was always okay with cottage pictures, because, despite the sunset and the dog and the chipmunk, there were usually a few that were funny or that captured a moment. Now, thanks to technology, the volume of photography out there is up, but the subject matter in our \u201calbums\u201d is just one person. Here\u2019s me on a stand-up paddleboard. Here\u2019s me cooking a hamburger. Here\u2019s me in the outhouse with a beer. What a kooky nut I am! And, last but not least, here\u2019s me doing yoga in front of a sunset.\nThe selfie doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going away any time soon, so I have to ask: what\u2019s the future of photography? Anyone, at any time, now has the ability to crack off a few hundred shots with their phone. And we do. But when you combine the cottager\u2019s penchant for poorly chosen subjects and bad light with the ability to take as many pictures as possible, does it sound the death knell for the entire art form? Will photography become so prolifically commonplace, so diluted and degraded, that good pictures will simply be steamrollered by a juggernaut of selfies (and pet worship, and food shots)? While I\u2019m generally a pessimist, there are a couple of things that offer hope. The first is that the instances of selfie-related injuries and even deaths are on the uptick worldwide, mostly involving falling, electrocution, or fatal interaction with transportation apparatus. It might seem callous, but this trend could thin the herd, a Darwinian solution to the proliferation of bad photos.\nThe other faint hope is the rising popularity of drones, which are appealing to certain cottagers because they can combine the nerdiness of radio-controlled flight with the artistry of aerial photography. In capable hands, they produce beautiful and dramatic sequences worthy of a feature lm. In the hands of your neighbour, they take overhead shots of broken stuff hidden behind your shed. Drones are not easy to operate, and, right now, they are relatively expensive. But it is my hope that when prices drop enough that you get one free with every Happy Meal, cottagers will embrace the upgrade. It surely follows that as wayward drones inevitably spiral down and pancake into the water, smack into flagpoles, or get torn apart by horny ravens, the swollen mass of bad photography will shrink.\nI think Cottage Life could do a lot to reduce the volume of bad cottage photography by replacing its annual photo contest with a Pictorial Arts Contest, open to two-dimensional images drawn by human hand, whether in ink, charcoal, paint, or crayon. This might help cottagers slow down and look at the world of beauty around us. I imagine it could produce entries such as Aunt Meg\u2019s Sun Hat, still life, acrylic on board. Or Wakesetting at Dawn, left-handed charcoal study. Someone might even take the time for Web Life: Spider, Fly, and Dewdrop, watercolour on rough-press paper.\nCertainly, it\u2019s a trail-blazing idea, but the cynic in me sees trouble ahead. Sure, still lifes and colour studies would show up, but I fear these entries would be overwhelmed by self-portraits, rendered in ink and oil and crayons and probably even human blood. I know that self- portraiture has been a standard form in fine art for centuries. But given our current societal norms, I think my fledgling Pictorial Arts Contest, just like John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing, could introduce us to something new and hideous and terrifying. Like the Self-Portrait Selfie.\nMark my words, you will be terrified. I see Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Portrait of a Man in Red Chalk recreated as Portrait of Dan the Man in Red Sweatpants and Frida Kahlo\u2019s Self Portrait with Braid as Me and this Yummy Braid of Organic Garlic. Most agree that The Desperate Man by Gustave Courbet is an arresting work. But I fear the art-loving cottagers will appreciate Desperate Man Being Licked by Cats even more. Pretty sad. That\u2019s why I plan to win this thing once I learn to paint. How hard can it be? Inspired by Salvador Dal\u00ed and Hieronymus Bosch, mine will be a dark self-portrait selfie. Dominating the dock, I take a pretty convincing Cow Face Pose, while a beagle wearing a lifejacket and a bandana sits in my lap holding a crystal bowl of radishes in his tiny grabbers, which are actually crayfish claws. (My face, by the way, isa melted clock.) It is dark, even though the sunset beyond our tilted horizon is bright. Smoke and ash and something else backdrops my perfect Gomukhasana pose. It is thousands of drones and horny ravens, and they are fighting over the future of photography. In my heart, I am really cheering for the ravens.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/cottagelife.com\/general\/this-photo-will-selfie-destruct\/"}

{"text":"Access #1: Follow Baker Gulch Trail for 5 miles until the junction for the Parika Lake Trail on the left.\nAccess #2: Hike the Baker Pass Trail from Baker Pass to the Parika Lake Trail.\nAccess #3: Hike the Bowen Gulch Trail to Fairview Pass.\nThe Parika Trail travels through some of the wildest and most primitive country in the Sulphur District. Camping spots are available and fishing is good in the lake. NO FIRES ALLOWED at Parika Lake. From the top of the trail, hikers can climb both Fairview Mountain to the south and Parika Peak to the north. West of the Divide, a trail leads to the south and around Fairview Mountain to a junction where the Parika Trail continues to the west, and the Bowen Pass can be reached to the south.\nReport: This is a spectacular trail to an unspoiled mountain lake at the foot of twelve thousand foot peaks in the Never Summer Wilderness. The trail begins at the Baker\/Bowen trailhead in the Kawuneechee Valley on the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park. The trail crosses the valley and the Colorado River en route to the Never Summer Wilderness and national park boundary, soon after entering an old growth pine forest. At the boundary, you follow nearby the main creek in the Baker Gulch through a lush forest, where the trail often rises above the creek affording awesome views of a small canyon. Look for moose near the creek and in the small meadows along the trail; we spotted four in close proximity to the trail! As the trail climbs, it crosses large talus fields at the foot of baker mountain and several hundred feet below an old mining road, which you eventually join and leave soon after. We spotted a young mountain lion near one of the talus fields approximately two miles from the trialhead, which was an awesome, and nervous encounter. The lion was quickly bounding away from us, and we only had a few seconds to view it before it dissappeared into the woods. Turn back frequently for awesome views of the continential divide and Longs Peak to the east. Eventually, you will join the mining road mentioned earlier, which follows a calm stream. In a couple hundred yards, however, you will need to cross the creek on a flat timber bridge to continue on the Baker\/Parika lake trail. The trial yet again crosses talus fields and eventually comes into a magnificent young growth forest with commanding views of the mountains and possible wildlife. The trail will eventually interstect, and stay left for Parika Lake, right for Baker Pass. The trial to Parika Lake soon begins an arduous climb through another forest near the main gulch creek to another magnificent park just below the lake. You will see a sign for another Baker Pass spur. Stay straight and climb the final hill to Parika Lake. Enjoy the hot sun, the beautiful views and the many marmots that will keep watchful eye from their lofty rock formations. Return back down the same trail, and again keep your eyes peeled for moose, deer and maybe even a mountain lion sighting!\nConditions: The trail crosses many small tributaries that flow quite heavily in the spring and well into July or even August. These tributaries, while usually easy to cross (watch your slippery step) can be slick and make the trail quite muddy. While on the talus slopes, watch your step as well because there is a lot of loose rock for tripping and slipping. There were no large trees to cross on our trip, however, the sun beamed with commanding heat and we were glad we lathered up with tanning lotion before the hike. Keep watchful eye on the mountains in front of you, because storms come quickly off the Never Summer peaks, especially in the afternoon and evening.\nWater Availability: Water is readily available throughout this hike in the main Baker Gulch creek as well as in Parika Lake. Be sure to treat the water with tablets or a water purifier before drinking. Especially with the abundant presence of wildlife around.\nRecommended Clothing: On a warm Sunday afternoon in July, the temperatures were in the high 70s and low 80s. The sun was extremely hot in the open areas, but thankfully there were some reprives in when the trial wandered through the various forests. We were comfortable in hiking boots\/wool socks, hiking shorts and a poly hiking shirt (short sleeve). While stopping for lunch at Parika Lake, however, if the sun was behind the clouds, the temperature dropped quickly and we were glad we brought our lightweight rain coats. Sunglasses are a must!\nSuggested Accessories: Hiking poles are very helpful to negotiate the prevalent loose rock on the talus slopes, as well as over the creek tributaries that can be quite slippery. I also spotted brook, brown or rainbow trout in Parika Lake. I don't believe there are any Greenback Cutthrout in the Never Summer waters.\nBaker Pass Trail - The Baker Pass Trail, #29, is located north of Granby in the Never Summer Wilderness. It is accessed by the Baker Gulch Trail beginning in Rocky Mountain National Park.\nBowen Gulch Trail - The Bowen Gulch Trail is located north of Granby. It begins at the Bowen Baker Trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park and branches to either Blue Lake, Bowen Lake, or Bowen Pass.","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/www.wildernet.com\/pages\/activity.cfm?actid=021008IO*15634hw&areaid=COGRAN&rectype=Backpacking&startrecord=2&fromPage=summary&CU_ID=1"}

If you have a strong track record in asset-backed development then we can offer you a challenging, rewarding career of extraordinary variety, working in everything from healthcare to education. There is no better place in the business to develop your career in the direction that interests you.\nMorgan Sindall is an exciting place to work. It\u2019s very fast-paced and you have a lot of autonomy. That\u2019s the main reason I joined six years ago \u2013 I wanted to be able to take responsibility for my own decisions. We have that independence but it\u2019s also a tight, cohesive team. This is the best company I\u2019ve worked for.\nI\u2019m responsible for leading bids from the moment we find out about them to the point when we sign the deal. I work on a national scale so I go wherever the work is. Sometimes I\u2019m in London running client meetings, and some days I work from home in Devon, doing quiet, concentrated work.\nYou have to be flexible and versatile as there is so much variety in this role.\nWorking here has been an exciting journey. I worked on some challenging projects at the beginning that taught me to be tenacious. I started out on a fifty-million pound library and now I\u2019m bidding on projects double that size. Over time I\u2019ve gained a better understanding, more responsibility and a less reactive approach. I\u2019m very ambitious and I want to keep on tackling complex projects and the challenges they bring.\nI joined Morgan Sindall Investments (MSIL) in May 2006 having worked for the previous 20-years with national contracting \/ development organisations. I joined MSIL at a time of major growth in the education sector, supporting the business on growing its key education opportunities culminating in the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. I was excited by the challenge of helping the company achieve its objectives. The initial challenge was to position the business to compete and win larger projects under the BSF programme which we have successfully achieved.\nAt MSIL there is a great team-working culture, everyone driving their ideas forward with similar values and beliefs. Our business is ostensibly about winning bids and creating successful businesses and we\u2019re all in it together. Everyone mucks in and it\u2019s a very flat structure. This kind of work isn\u2019t easy \u2013 it can take a year and a half to finish a bid and when you win it\u2019s fantastic, but it takes a little time to recover from a loss. You need to be very hardworking in this role, able to lead large diverse teams, encourage teamwork and ensure that you drive the best out of the skills and experiences available within that team. You need to keep on learning from every experience, good or bad.\nMy background is in healthcare \u2013 I was an NHS director of primary care and worked with hundreds of GPs. My best career advice is not to be afraid to change direction. I was originally an accountant at the NHS before transferring into services development. I then moved to Morgan Sindall because I felt that I could actually make a difference here and I get real job satisfaction from what we do. It\u2019s the best decision I ever made.\nI\u2019ve only been here a short while so there is still so much to learn. I\u2019m the general manager of three LIFT companies across the south and it\u2019s my job to build relationships with colleagues, customers and partners to generate new business.\nRight now we\u2019re working on projects in Crawley hospital as well as projects for new builds with GPs. So I\u2019m still working to improve communities and healthcare providers. When I stand outside one of our buildings and see how well it work s and see people making use of it, I feel very proud to have been a part of it.\nI joined Morgan Sindall in 2008 and have been very fortunate to have been able to develop myself here. I first started out as a receptionist before quickly becoming a Project Administrator, working on large PFI projects around the country and subsequently being promoted to Proposals Manager.\nMy current role is to manage production of our proposals, ensuring that our bid documents are of the highest quality and meet the set deadlines to give our team the very best chance of securing new work. Working within bid teams is the most rewarding part of my job. I would describe my colleagues as committed, hard-working and supportive.\nThe bidding environment can be intense but the variety of work keeps it fresh and exciting.\nWe take a very collaborative approach here and everyone has been willing to share their knowledge and help me progress. I feel proud to be part of a winning team and to work for a company that invests in its employees\u2019 development.\nI remember thinking at the end of my first interview how much I already wanted to work here. I could see that the culture was a really good fit for me. Everyone here is dedicated and motivated but somehow the office remains a light-hearted and relaxed environment. Our division really wants people to succeed and, although you have to be determined, my experience is that MSIL will support you and your goals.\nI\u2019ve now been at Morgan Sindall for just under a year and I can\u2019t believe how quickly the time has gone by. I\u2019ve been learning to run the financial processes here, which has been challenging coming from a different way of working in my previous role \u2013 but it\u2019s so important to stretch yourself and try new things.\nI\u2019m particularly enjoying working on process improvement in a new environment with new systems and processes to understand. Becoming a financial controller was a great opportunity for me and I\u2019m very happy to be in this role. There\u2019s still so much to learn but I\u2019m always thinking about how we can improve the way that the finance team works.\nWe strive to ensure that the salary and benefits packages we offer our colleagues are the best in the industry. What you get will depend on what you do \u2013 and how long you stay with us.\nJuggling work commitments and family life is a challenge for everyone \u2013 that\u2019s why Morgan Sindall Investments people are eligible for enhanced maternity and paternity benefits, as well as childcare vouchers and a great holiday allowance. We have an excellent work life balance.\nAs you might expect, there\u2019s also a contributory pension plan and a life assurance scheme \u2013 and a discount scheme that gets you money off everything from mobile phones to DIY supplies.","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/morgansindallgroupcareers.com\/msinvestments\/why-join-us"}

Signage asking visitors to leave $1 per bottle on the honor system was posted next to a transparent (but securely mounted) cash box. In partnership with Ustream, hidden cameras were arranged to provide live video feeds of each pop-up store on the interactive honestcities.com website that documented how honest people actually were and tracked the real-time honesty results of each city.\nIn keeping with its mission-driven approach, Honest Tea is donating all of the money collected \u2013nearly $5,000 to three non-profit organizations. Honest Tea will also match the funds collected, bringing the total donated to $10,000.\n0 Response to \"Boston = 2nd Most Honest City\"\nNational Hot Dog Day = Free Hot Dogs!","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/www.beantownbloggery.com\/2011\/07\/boston-2nd-most-honest-city.html"}

We covered seventeen presentations over the course of ten days which were dedicated to seeing the truth of the Character of Love through the lens of Seventh-day Adventist teaching. And what an amazing experience it was! We had over 65 visitors from the community attend, five folks accepted Jesus as their Savior for the very first time, five other folks requested more information on baptism, and eleven more signed up to continue with Bible Studies. These were responding positively to our unique teachings such as the Sabbath, the State of the Dead, Annihilation, and some of our prophetic understandings\u2013all as a means of more deeply understanding and experiencing God\u2019s love for us in the light of the cross.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/renewedheartministries.com\/news\/Pleasant-Hill-Community-Encounters-Life-Unlimited"}

{"text":"Learning Lions is a non-profit organization enabling young adults in impoverished rural areas of Eastern Africa to work, and to live a life full of opportunity while remaining in their home area.\nThe students are equipped with IT and media skills and are then encouraged to become entrepreneurs. Through selling digital services online they become self-sustaining and can even employ new cohorts of trainees.\nIn 2015 we started off in Turkana county, North Kenya, where traditional sources of income are extremely limited due to infertile soil and poor infrastructure.\nOur program is structured into three subsequent units: \"Learning Lions\" trains talented and motivated young adults with high value skills in the areas of programming, graphic design and media production.\nThe students from the educational program are then invited to stay on campus as trainees of \"Digital Lions\", our fair-trade IT-outsourcing agency. Here, they start working with international customers and gather hands-on business experience.\nWhen the Lions feel confident in the contact with clients, the incubator \"Startup Lions\" provides them with the necessary funds and tools so that they can launch their own start-up and become economically independent.\nLearning Lions offers its students a structured learning plan with a fixed time-frame and clear learning objectives developed in close cooperation with our experienced partner Tunapanda. The training takes place at our campus in Lodwar, Turkana, where the students are also accommodated.\nOne important aspect of the 3-month training is to build the students\u2019 computer skills and bring them to a level comparable to that of young adults in the developed world. Beyond that, students are trained in skills such as communication, teamwork and time management and gain their first insights into the different areas in which they can specialise in the Advanced Training.\nThose students who performed well in the Basic Training are invited to stay on campus for 6 months of specialised education. In close coordination with their mentors, students practice specific digital services which can be sold in global online marketplaces. In weekly review sessions they receive feedback on the quality of their work. In this way the students are prepared for real orders and can start working for clients at an early stage of their training.\nCourses are delivered by a combination of local and oversea teachers \u2013 professionals who volunteer with us for short-term sabbaticals.\n\"I will be forever grateful to Learning Lions for the skills and opportunity they gave me.\"","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/learninglions.org\/"}

{"text":"Is recreational marijuana legal in Orlando? If I have Alzheimer's disease, can I apply for medical cannabis? And when can I start growing weed in my backyard?\nA: The purpose was to expand the number of patients who could access marijuana. In 2014, Florida legislators passed a measure to offer a non-euphoric strain of medical cannabis low in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the chemical that gets you high, but rich in cannabidiol, which has been found to help with seizures. The measure, called the \"Charlotte's Web\" bill, was mostly aimed at helping patients with epilepsy and similar, specific conditions. In 2016, lawmakers expanded the program to allow terminally ill patients to access full-strength medical marijuana, regardless of THC levels. After years of legal wrangling between the Florida Legislature, the state Department of Health and prospective growers, we finally started growing and dispensing marijuana in 2016. During November's election, Florida's medical marijuana constitutional amendment passed by a landslide with 71 percent of voters in favor. Amendment 2 makes full-strength marijuana legal and broadens the definition of \"debilitating medical condition\" to include cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV, AIDS, Crohn's disease, PTSD, Parkinson's disease, ALS, multiple sclerosis, or a \"debilitating medical condition ... for which a physician believes that the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient.\" That last part of the Amendment is currently being hotly debated by Florida health officials and advocates. The state Department of Health has proposed allowing the Florida Board of Medicine to decide what conditions could qualify a patient for medical cannabis. Advocates argue individual doctors can decide if marijuana will help their patient or not.\nQ: That's a lot of mumbo-jumbo. I just want to know one thing. Who qualifies?\nA: Amendment 2 does not change Florida's recreational drug possession laws. You can still be arrested for driving under the influence of marijuana or smoking cannabis in public. The law also does not affect federal law, which completely prohibits marijuana possession and distribution. While President Donald Trump has expressed that he's in favor of medical marijuana, the same can't be said for his appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions. After he was sworn in, the former Alabama senator created a crime reduction task force to review the federal Department of Justice's existing policies, including how it enforces marijuana laws. That could hint at a future crackdown on recreational marijuana, though it's still unclear how, if at all, Sessions' policies could affect medicinal marijuana.\nA: No. Florida's supply of medical marijuana for patients is grown, cultivated and produced by seven nurseries across the state that have partnered with companies to do the processing, sales and marketing. Nurseries are opening dispensaries where they can sell their products, which usually include some form of oil or tinctures, or delivering the medicine to homes. Patients cannot grow their own medical marijuana, regardless of condition. Smoking cannabis, medicinal or not, is still illegal.\nA: No. The city of Orlando decriminalized small amounts of marijuana by allowing police officers to give out citations instead of making arrests. If you're caught with 20 grams of cannabis or less or with marijuana paraphernalia, an officer can choose to give you a citation with a $100 fine if you're a first-time offender, or a $200 fine for a second offense. Repeat offenders can get a fine of up to $500 and a court appearance. Offenders can also waive their fine by going to a diversion program that requires substance-abuse education or community service. Remember, it's up to the officer's discretion whether to give you a citation, or arrest you if they suspect you're involved in a more serious crime. Marijuana possession is still a misdemeanor under Florida law.\nQ: OK, I've got all my paperwork in order. Where can I buy medical cannabis in Orlando?\nA: Right now, the only physical dispensary where you would be able to walk in and purchase medicine is Knox Medical, at 1901 N. Orange Ave., next to White Wolf Cafe in Ivanhoe Village. Knox Medical, a company based out of Knox Nursery in Winter Garden, hasn't opened yet, but when it does open in the coming weeks, it will only be able to sell cannabis of the low-THC variety. No other dispensary can open in Orlando or Orange County because of a moratorium by those local governments on dispensaries. Orlando's moratorium ends in July, while Orange County's moratorium ends next month. If you can't wait for the medicine, Knox Medical also does home deliveries, as do several other dispensaries across the state. Adam Sharon, a spokesperson for Knox, says there's no set date for when Orlando's first dispensary will open. When we find out, we'll let you know.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.orlandoweekly.com\/orlando\/florida-has-new-complex-marijuana-laws-heres-what-they-really-mean\/Content?oid=3889964&utm_source=widget&utm_medium=articleblog&utm_campaign=endofarticle&utm_content=PeopleWhoLiked"}
{"text":"When it comes to food slicers, style is probably not what comes to mind when thinking of how they look. However, this Graef EVO E 20 food slicer is just that, a gorgeous piece of kitchen equipment that will look great in any kitchen and get people talking. Of course it doesn\u2019t just sit there and look pretty, it really is a great piece of machinery too! Check out our Graef slicer review and see what all the fuss is about.\nIt\u2019s a truly striking bit of kit that you can have in your home. If looks are important to you then you\u2019ll probably not search any further than the Graef slicer. Thankfully it has a lot more going for it than just it\u2019s looks.\nIt\u2019s a meat slicer and a bread slicer as well as easily cutting through cheese and vegetables. It does each job with ease and collects it on a (rather small) tray that comes with the slicer.\nIt\u2019s definitely not a budget option for a food slicer but if you\u2019re looking for something solidly built that will last a long time I don\u2019t think you can go very wrong with this one.\nThe 17cm circular blade is adequate for cutting all sorts of meat from your Sunday joint to deli meat. It\u2019s also great for slicing bread easily, vegetables, cheese anything that you feel the need to slice thinly!\nIt will slice from 1mm to about 20mm in thickness so really great for a variety of jobs. You vary the thickness using the dial at the side of the machine.\nIt removes easily for cleaning and spare blades can also be bought on Amazon as well.\nThe slicer is operated by two buttons at the rear and top of the machine. This can be done by one hand \u2013 you can hold the buttons down and slice or if you press the buttons in a specific order it will keep the blade running for you. You simply press one of the buttons again to stop the motor.\nslices meat, bread, cheeses and other foods.\nAlthough this video is in German you\u2019ll get a good look at what the slicer looks like.\nAs well as giving my own thoughts and ideas on a product I really like to look around the internet to get a general view of what other buyers people have said about this machine.\nI was really expecting that people wouldn\u2019t like the price of this machine \u2013 it\u2019s in the premium price range \u2013 but almost every review I\u2019ve seen on Amazon says that it is well worth the cost. It does the job so well that it seems that it\u2019s worth it for almost everyone who buys it!\nThere are very few negatives around, a few said that the turning dial was a little stiff on it and that it was fiddly to clean at first but that you get used to it and it gets quicker.\nOverall I think that this is an excellent machine. If you know you\u2019ll do a lot of slicing and want to get the most out of your breads and meats then you\u2019ll find this one an excellent purchase. Oh, and it looks awesome on the work surface!\nYou can see my overall buying guide, where this is featured, for the best food slicer here.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/busybakers.co.uk\/graef-evo-e-20-food-slicer-review\/"}
{"text":"Many people have had to leave their homes for HCMC, wile others have lodged complaints to local authorities and state management agencies as the living environment has been destroyed.\nDinh Trung, former secretary of the Binh Thuan provincial Party Committee, is one of the signers of the petition to local authorities asking them to stop the operation of titanium mines.\nTrung, after consulting with scientists, believes that the Binh Thuan provincial People\u2019s Committee made an unreasonable decision when developing titanium mines. It concluded that the titanium reserves in the province are up to 599 million tons, worth $140 billion. The conclusion was not based on scientific research, but just on estimates.\nSince the day titanium mines became operational, poplar trees have been dying gradually, the grass covers on the hills are no longer green, the water sources have become polluted and locals have had to leave their homes.\nTran Van Can, 36, and all of his family members in Hoa Thang commune of Bac Binh district, who raised goats and grew vegetables, had to leave for HCMC.\n\u201cThe goats usually got sick, died and caused losses. As we lived near a titanium mine, dust particles stuck to food,\u201d he complained.\nMeanwhile, as Can\u2019s son was frequently ill, he decided to leave his home.\nLocated several kilometers far from the Thien Ai titanium mine, the watermelon garden of TVH has witnessed crop failure. Watermelons cannot grow, but instead wither because of the lack of water and nutrients. Offshore fishing has been the major breadearner for her family over the last three years.\nWhen reporters visited the areas around titanium mining sites, they saw a lot of red water lakes amid sand banks. There were no trees. And there were only old people and children, while young people had left for cities to look for jobs.\nAs the sand banks have been excavated, the poplar forests have been destroyed. Many people have petitioned local authorities and many state agencies, requesting to find solutions that bring benefits to both investors and locals.\nHowever, there has been no reply.\nH, a man in Mui Ne Ward of Phan Thiet City, said he and some neighbors visited titanium mines every night and took photos of illegal activities with their smartphones to provide to agencies.\nHowever, he finally had to stop doing this because he was intimidated many times by strange men.\nTrung affirmed that the massive titanium exploitation has exhausted the underground water sources. Miners have to use underground and sea water to sort ore, and then discharge waste water to the lakes nearby.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/vnexpressnews.net\/environment\/titanium-mining-in-binh-thuan-affecting-environment-peoples-lives\/"}

The building, furnishings and equipment were funded by us and a grant from the Ross Foundation. It can accommodate as many as 40 bassinets and has bathrooms and a laundry for mothers. The dedication ceremony was marked by speeches, singing and prayers. It was attended by the hospital staff, local government officials, clergy and teachers. The bishop of the diocese presided and he was assisted by the district governor. Accompanied by much fanfare, we were presented with a commemorative scroll which expressed gratitude for our support and the generosity of our donors.\nMany hours were spent planning the details of the next gravity flow water project which will be a two line extension of the Kajwenge project which has recently been completed. Construction of Kajwenge was in three phases from 2009 to 2011 at a cost of $113,700.00. Also, we have earmarked $14,000.00 to update the oldest, 42 year old line in the system. This includes replacing the concrete retaining basin at the source. Without question, our support of the water projects is the most important and cost effective. Preventing water related diseases saves countless lives, thousands of hours required for water gathering, caring for sick family members, and the precarious financial resources of tens of thousands who are able to avoid clinic visits and hospitalizations.\nWe reviewed the funding of our ongoing smaller projects which include traditional birth attendants, community health workers, microfinance, the animal exchange program and aid to the disabled.\nOur resources have been severely depleted this year as a result of funding the initiatives described herein. Thus, our need for contributions is as great as it has ever been.

{"text":"Poly(triazine imide) with incorporated lithium chloride has recently attracted substantial attention due to its photocatalytic activity for water splitting. However, an apparent H\/Li disorder prevents the delineation of structure-property relationships, for example, with respect to bandgap tuning. Herein, we show that through a combination of one-and two-dimensional, multinuclear solid-state NMR spectroscopy, chemical modelling, automated electron diffraction tomography, and an analysis based on X-ray pair distribution functions, it is finally possible to resolve the H\/Li substructure. In each cavity, one hydrogen atom is bound to a bridging nitrogen atom, while a second one protonates a triazine ring. The two lithium ions within each cavity are positioned between two nitrogen atoms of neighbouring triazine rings. The thereby induced local dipole moments cause slight buckling of the framework and lateral displacements of the Cl- ions at a coherence length below 2 nm. Nevertheless, the average structure conforms to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1). In this way, we demonstrate that, in particular, the above-mentioned techniques allow for smart interplay in delineating the real structure of PTI\/LiCl.\nMesch, Maria B., et al. \"Solving the Hydrogen and Lithium Substructure of Poly(triazine imide)\/LiCl Using NMR Crystallography.\" Chemistry - A European Journal 22.47 (2016): 16876-16888.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/cris.fau.de\/converis\/portal\/publication\/108796864?lang=de_DE"}
{"text":"I had the good fortune a few moments ago to dine at Armando al Pantheon, in Rome. Just steps from the Pantheon, Armando offers a paradise amidst a sea of mediocre and embarrassing tourist traps. As my friend Katie Parla has documented, restaurant culture in Rome has declined in the last decade, and it is harder and harder to eat well in the historic center of Rome. Armando feels like the most unlikely and precious of gifts.\nArmando is a traditional Roman trattoria. That is, it is family run (multi-generational), small (about 30 seats), and traditional (mostly classic Roman dishes). By a stroke of great luck, it was the first place I ever ate in Rome, and I\u2019ve been going back ever since. The kitchen at Armando is run by Claudio, while his brother Fabrizio runs the dining room, and what is most remarkable about Armando is that Claudio\u2019s cooking is pitch perfect every time. In a city where even the best restaurants do some dishes better than others, Armando has a consistency which places it in a special class.\nAll good cooking, like most good things, is based on having good taste. This is the difference between a decent and a great string quartet performance, or a decent performance and great performance of a play. Good taste is hard or impossible to teach, but those that have the gift can perceive it. Tonight at Armando, I had one of the most classic and simple of Roman pastas: spaghetti all\u2019 aglio, olio, e peperoncino (garlic, oil, and hot pepper). As I\u2019ve written before, this is one of the most devilish sauces, because its minimal ingredient list requires everything to be perfect and balanced. At the center of successful cooking is proper seasoning with salt, the ability to draw out flavor from ingredients, but in a subtle and unobtrusive way, in a way that simply makes the ingredients taste more of themselves. This is this gift Claudio seems to have. Every bite of his cooking is full of character, but one never tires or wearies eating his cooking, as is the case in so many restaurants, particularly good ones in America. In America, so many chefs seem trained to produce flavors which are exciting for a few bites, but quickly make one weary through over-seasoning or lack of freshness. Others restaurants, such as the one I visited for lunch today, offer excellent dishes, but portion size is so overwhelming that the dishes can hardly be enjoyed through the end before weariness sets in.\nThis elusive quality of balance and taste is what we strive for at Old Tioga Farm, and dining at restaurants such as Armando inspires us to seek that same ideal. Great cooking is not at all about being a \u201ccelebrity chef\u201d, but rather about the ability to be humble enough to make one\u2019s cooking about honoring the integrity of high-quality ingredients.\nAs my friend Katie explained today, even many Romans have lost the taste for quality that is needed to appreciate Armando. If you find yourself in Rome, go to Armando. You might not speak Italian, you might not be Roman, you might show yourself immediately to be a tourist, but express delight in Claudio\u2019s cooking, heap praise upon the wonderful dishes that come from his kitchen, and you\u2019ll earn gratitude and appreciation from one of Rome\u2019s finest restaurants.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/oldtiogafarm.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/11\/a-love-letter-to-armando-al-pantheon\/"}

{"text":"Many of you have taken steps to improve your photography, especially as we continue to share our flies. I've been using the same point and shoot Canon for the past 8 years and really wanted to expand a bit, so I thought I would share my progress and hopefully many of you would be kind enough to share your insights and shorten my learning curve. No doubt this is an exercise beyond what is necessary. I just want to make some gains and explore some of the flexibility of a DSLR. Most of this should apply to compact cameras as well.\nThese links will lead you through this thread where certain aspects of fly photography are discussed. This thread is a conversation so it is not a tidy presentation of categories, and the entire thread should be read in full, but these might help navigate a subject of interest.\nSo briefly, I recently acquired a used Nikon D5100, a 40mm prime Macro lens and a tripod. I have a couple close-up filters that I haven't tried, would like to get a set of extension tubes to test and a ring light to try, but for now I'm working with the lens and the two Ott lights that I used in my past set up. It sounds like it's getting complicated, but there is a method to the madness and the end should result in some flexibility for a variety of shots, but also lead to reproducing very consistent images, not unlike the comparative style that I've used for my the past few years. I just wanted to show the beginnings of the process and hopefully get some guidance to move forward.\nFirst attempt with new DSLR camera.\nPheasant Tail Nymph with CDC Wingcase - 2015 - I might need a soft filter paper over light sources.\nSome of the best images I've seen are of Catskill dries standing on a stone, but that works because they stand like little soldiers in their photogenic posture. It's the soft-hackles that pose the most trouble when not using a vise or clamp of some sort. Some of the better displays have the hook point very slightly stuck in something in a way that holds the fly in a photogenic position and some do a fine job lying them on their sides, but for many this is difficult. I'd love to see examples of what you like most in photos. Comments on the merits of the well lit profile view per Hans, etc, vs. other display techniques would also be interesting to explore.\nThanks in advance for any input. We seem to have many of the best in the world knocking around this forum. It would mean a lot to have this topic explored further for those who are interested. I'll post my old set up and when I get a better idea of what I want from my new arrangement I'll get pics of this too.\nI just got done reading the text you have written about this photographic process and I find it utterly fascinating! I have made some recent strides in photography and particularly in saving and sending images. I admit, I have a very long journey ahead of me but, it it fun learning the basics and then seeing the good results of those learning episodes and I chalk them up to experienced and wiser heads who help me along the way! Yourself included! Thanks for taking us along on your travels in learning!\nI have to disagree with your assessment on photo number one (a great looking pattern by the way!) that the lite source needs a softer filter paper. I find the lite in that photo very pleasing and very unusual that I have never seen the clarity and detail enhanced like it is in this one! Consider this lighting option in future photo's from your shop! I really like it!\nI have always liked your photographic style and with improvements such as this, it just keeps getting better and better! Some thoughts for you from a guy on the low end of the scale!\nThere is a balance to be struck. I realize not everyone will care to go down this path and it's certainly not necessary, but for those who are interested I wanted to add a few links and would be curious to see others you've found. I'll edit this post to include links that we find useful. If you recall threads we've shared here, please post them. I know lots of our best material is tucked away on page 6 of seemingly unrelated threads. Below are links that provide great reading from folks on this forum, folks who have done a nice job outlining their own process, exceptional examples, and finally some more technical information to help us better understand the aspects that determine our final results.\nKarsten Neben on Photographing Flies for Dummies - This is loaded with keen insight, really well done. Brilliant, mate.\nHans' Flytier's Page - Hans Weilenmann has consistently produced the benchmark for this type of macro photography.\nDavid Stenstrom's Fly Tying - another exceptional fly photographer.\nIntro to Macro - Mark Libertone suggested this link a couple years ago.\nStendalen Photo Set-up - one of Martin's excellent fly shooting set-ups.\nPhotographing Flies - an earlier effort to address the topic by yours truly.\nMacro Backgrounds - Rodger shared this idea.\nHenning Saebo - YouTube Video for DSLR Fly Photography - a simple, clear process demonstrating his preferred settings.\nThe technical concepts: these will determine your results.\nDigital Camera Sensor Size - Hans was kind enough to point out some amazing links for understanding the fundamentals and the finer points.\nUnderstanding Depth of Field - every camera is different and this link clears much of the confusion.\nDiffraction - becomes another aspect that contributes to the overall equation. Thanks again, Hans.\nEditing and Post-processing - Again the cambridgeincolour.com site is very helpful.\nOne of the things I like about a DSLR is the ability to turn the auto-focus off. I find it annoying to get everything set the way I want it, and the AF decides it wants to select the backdrop as the focal point.\nI have\\n't progressed to the point of buying\/building\/repurposing a light box stage for making macro images. Most of mine are done with the fly in the vise and a sheet of craft foam for a backdrop.\nI have, and use, a 4x zoom \"filter\", which I screw onto the end of the 18-55 kit lens that came with the camera. My wide angle lens has a larger filter ring, and I haven't bought an adapter.\nI also generally shoot hand-held, with my tying light and the camera flash to give me a decent shutter speed. I do lose some depth of field this way, as the aperture gets bigger.\nI will be following this thread with interest. Macro photography has interested me for a while, but I've only been trying it myself for about a year. I'm looking forward to learning some new techniques.\nThank you for your comments and for this excellent link. That's a cool resource.\nI really have no idea why you are pursuing this, William. Your fly photos have always been sharp and clear enough to see all the color subtleties and tying details. I think you just have a lot of extra time and money that you don't know what else to do with, and you would rather be fooling around inside your house with high tech gear than be out on the water fishing someplace. Besides, when (not if) you do acquire all of the accoutrements and master their application, my point-and-shoot pictures will look even more mundane by comparison that they do now. Long story short, I'm just jealous .\nBill, I have a couple reasons for pursuing this. Maybe the most important is that a kind and generous friend gifted a fantastic set of flymphs tied in the Hidy style last Spring. I have wanted to photograph them and do them justice. It's worth doing well.\nGood topic William. I remember this post: http:\/\/www.flymphforum.com\/viewtopic.ph ... 12&start=0 by Stendalen. He has posted some very good pictures in the past. I really look forward to your future development. When you've got your mind set on something you usually get there. I agree with Doug; there is a quality in that recent photo of the Pheasant Tail that is lacking in the older one. It has a crispness that shows your tying skills better on my old ThinkPad screen.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/flymphforum.com\/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=6321"}
{"text":"NASA scientists have recently fired up the thrusters on the Voyager 1 Spacecraft - the farthest spacecraft from Earth - in an effort to reorient its antenna towards Earth.\nOriginally, scientists would have used the attitude control thrusters aboard the spacecraft to make the adjustments, however these have been wearing out during the voyage. Instead, NASA scientists tried using Voyager's 'trajectory correction maneuver' thrusters, located on the back side of the spacecraft.\nSince these hadn't been fired in 27 years, engineers were thrilled when they received an answer 19 hours and 35 minutes later that the four thrusters had worked perfectly.\n\"The Voyager team got more excited each time with each milestone in the thruster test. The mood was one of relief, joy and incredulity after witnessing these well-rested thrusters pick up the baton as if no time had passed at all,\" said Todd Barber, a propulsion engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.newsoftheuniverse.com\/2017\/12\/voyager-spacecraft-fires-up-thrusters.html"}

{"text":"This is a collection of quick and easy Apple related tips. Both for Computers and handheld devices such as iPhone, iPad etc.\nTime machine slow for you? Speed up the initial backup with the following command and run it in a terminal window. To open up terminal just search for it using spotlight and start it.\nWhen you enter the commands above you will be asked for your password. It is the same password you use when logging in to your Mac or installing new applications. It won\u2019t show the password when you are typing it.\nThe reason for time machines initial backup being slow is that it defaults to a low priority mode. When you enter the command above it will increase the priority with the cost of using up more resources from your Mac. The benefit here is that the initial backup will go much faster, and I would certainly welcome that over some more power savings.\nWhen you are done, just remember to return to the default mode, if not your machine may feel slow because not only time machine but other background tasks are affected by this command as well.\nWhen the initial backup is done it should be no big issues with the backups after that. In most cases it is the initial backup that makes time machine run slow. Most people just leave it on overnight and it takes care of itself, but if you are in a hurry the suggestions in this article should help.\nAre you backing up via WiFi? That can slow down backups. Make sure you are close to your access point \/ router or use a physical network cable to connect your Mac directly to the router.\nFormat or check the hard drive you are backing up to. Open up disk utility and run a check on your hard drive. Maybe the drive is getting bad, or a repartition and a reformat could help.\nIf you have cancelled or unexpectedly interrupted the previous backup time machine may take a longer time when making a new backup again.\nIf you are running antivirus try disabling it during the backup as it may slow it down.\nVirtualization apps like Vmware Fusion or Parallels can often write data to your hard drive and this may keep time machine going all the time. Consider excluding virtual machines from your backup.\nThey are organised into folders, first year and then event.\nIf you wanted to import this folder structure into Apple Photos it would require a lot of manual work. Especially if you have tens of thousands of photos.\nDoing manual work is stupid, that is why we made computers in the first place and a guy calling himself code!z have created a neat AppleScript that makes this process automatic.\nWhat you do is download the script you find here: ImportPhotoFolders. Find the ImportPhotoFolders.applescript and double click on it. You will get a window looking like the one below.\nPress the \u201cPlay\u201d button and a file selection window should appear. Navigate to the folder you would like to import and let the script do its magic. It will now import all those files into Photos making a folder of the root directory and albums from the folders inside the root directory.\nA very neat and free script to use if you want Apple Photos to handle all of your photos but still want to retain your directory structure.\nI recommend to make a small selection first, to see if everything works like it should.\nWhen you have a new system to set up there are always some applications you want to get installed and set up. Maybe you use another web browser, need dropbox, OpenOffice, Skype or other applications.\nWindows users have a free service called ninite, but is it available for Mac users? Not exactly, but you have something called: Get Mac Apps. The point of this is to click the apps you want to install and it will automatically get the newest version of all apps you want and give it to you in one convenient download.\nOf course you could go to each website and download it, but this way you dont have to visit each website and download one app at a time.\nAlso take a look at SetApp: Best Apps for Mac, Yours to Explore. It is a subscription service that gives you access to a lot of great Mac apps and its free to try out.\nTo add a spacer to your Macs dock so that you can organise the icons a little better you just have to right click the dock and select add\u2026. nope, sorry. Did you think it was so easy?\nThe dock should briefly disappear then appear again with a spacer you can drag wherever you want, like a normal icon. If you want more spacers you just run the same command above again. If you are finished in the terminal type exit and the window will close.\nIf you want to remove the spacer, just drag it off the dock as you would do when removing another icon.\nWith the release of the MacBook Pro in 2016 Apple also decided that the classic startup chime from 1999 had to go. If you are dealing with grief due to this know that it is possible to restore it again! You just have to do some typing in the terminal.\nYou dont need third party software to create a PDF file from something you want to print. This functionality is built into macOS. If you have a document, website or something similar you want a PDF file from just go to File->Print. (Or CMD+P).\nIn the print window that appears you should be able to save it as PDF. Having a printer installed is not necessary to get this working.\nIn other applications (like Numbers) you may have to go to File->Export to get a PDF file. This vill vary depending on application you use.\nLowest Mac Volume Still Too Loud?\nDid you know you can lower the volume on your Mac even more? Without making it completely silent? If you hold the shift and alt key while pressing the volume adjust key it will decrease\/increase the audio by \u00bc step instead.\nIf you want to maximise your window in macOS a quick way without having to enter fullscreen you hold down the alt button and click the green button. If you hold the cursor above the green button and press alt at the same time you will see that it changes to a plus sign. When you see the plus sign click the button and the window size will increase so the content inside fits.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/all-about-apple.com\/category\/mac-tips\/"}

{"text":"England got everything they wanted on the final day at the Oval - victory by 118 runs, a last stirring send-off for the retiring Alastair Cook, and a record-breaking 564th Test wicket for James Anderson. But they were made to wait. And fret.\nThe day lasted far longer than they might have liked, and there was a scary rhythm to it. Eerie quiet followed by a CRACK. The sound of mouths hitting the floor. Another CRACK. The beating of hearts against chests. CRACK. CRACK. CRACK. India came to the ground as the team that needed to survive 90 overs. But by tea, they were taking a proper stab at a target of 464. Nothing in the vicinity had ever been chased in the history of Test cricket.\nThe equation read 166 off 33 overs, and there were two centurions at the crease. KL Rahul got there abandoning most of his caution. It had served him poorly in England, leading him to average 16 until the start of this Test. Attacking the ball, on the other hand, brought him 149 runs. Rishabh Pant might have come to the same conclusion after recording a 29-ball duck in Southampton. He reached his maiden Test hundred off only 117 deliveries, with a six over deep midwicket. India started to believe.\nMadness doesn't begin to cover what they did in the 44.3 overs they were together, just as madness doesn't begin to cover the ball that broke that 204-run partnership. Adil Rashid - for long the forgotten asset - ran in from around the wicket at the right-handed Rahul, and pitched the ball in the rough some three feet away from the line of the stumps. The batsman cleared his front leg and prepared to flick the ball away, except it spun. It spun viciously, ridiculously, and unbelievably to tip the bail down from the off stump.\nEngland were effectively a bowler short - Stuart Broad was on the field with strapping on his right side, a souvenir from taking Jasprit Bumrah bouncer on the ribs - and it almost seemed like they were content to wait for the second new ball to make a play. Their two most prolific wicket-takers bowled only nine of the first 49 overs. The others resorted to bouncers - a strange tactic on a slow pitch. There were even times when Rahul batted without a slip.\nIndia had no pressure to deal with as they ransacked 131 runs at 4.37 per over in the middle session. But there was just too much time on the clock. And too many runs to go after. It all ended - in rather slapstick fashion - with No. 10 farming the strike from No. 11, and two balls later getting his middle stump knocked back. Anderson roared in triumph - he had just deposed Glenn McGrath as the most prolific fast bowler in Test cricket - and ran into the arms of his team-mates. They asked him to lead them off the field, but he insisted that Cook should get that honour, and then choked up during an interview when asked if he would miss his mate.\nThere was - realistically - only one winner possible after Cook and Joe Root had struck fairytale hundreds. But it was fun as Rahul and Pant made everyone think about what if. They got together at 121 for 5 with more than two sessions left to play. But both men took the match situation and smuggled it out of sight. Nobody who watched their partnership would have realised that they were playing for the team that was behind in the match, and the series.\nRahul launched fast bowlers over the top. The lack of pace in the pitch assisted him in fixing a problem against the inswinger, as did his adjusting his front foot stride, taking it down the pitch instead of across, and slowing down his bat-speed, at least while defending. But whenever there was width, he did not hold back. There was a six off Ben Stokes that was downright majestic, standing tall on the back foot and cutting the ball to smithereens.\nPant looked special when he flayed spin along the ground, and weird when he hit in the air. He just puts so much into the swing that he literally falls over, meaning even his lofted drives over cover end up looking like skewed sweep shots. A much more proper rendition of it, over midwicket, crowned him the first Indian wicketkeeper to hit a century in England. These two were India's top-scorers in the 2018 IPL. A few months on, they put on India's highest partnership in a Test series in England.\nBut the lower order could do only so much to mask a scorecard that once read 2 for 3. India's biggest problem in this series - especially when it was alive - was a lack of runs from their top order. Rahul's century comes as hope for the future, but it won't quite wash over the fact that this team has once again fallen short away from home.\n#PoliteEnquiries: Which problems have England actually solved?","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/tv5.espn.com\/cricket\/series\/18018\/report\/1119553\/day\/5\/england-vs-india-5th-test-ind-eng-2018"}

{"text":"A top economic advisor to the Australian Government recently suggested in an op-ed published by the national daily The Australian that one scenario we should be prepared for is global cooling due to a possible change in solar activity. Certain reports in the U.S. media have also suggested cooling may already be upon us because of the sun. What is one to make of this?\nShould we be prepared for global cooling driven by changes in solar output?\nThere is much to be learned about the sun\u2019s role in climate. However, best estimates suggest the sun\u2019s variability over recent decades has played a small role in observed climate change] (footnote 1). Though it is still difficult to predict changes in the sun, modeled projections suggest even a return to the \u201cMaunder Minimum\u201d (footnote 2) would provide only minor compensation for anticipated greenhouse-gas warming.\nThe attention on the sun serves as a reminder that modern climate science arose, in part, from efforts to address societal concerns over global cooling, setting the stage for advances in climate science over the past forty years. There was concern among some policy makers that the decades of cooling from the mid-1940s through the mid 1970\u2019s represented the onset of a new ice age.\nIn the 1970s the Little Ice Age, and the \u201cYear Without a Summer\u201d following the 1815 Tambora eruption, were known. So the dangers of a cold climate were perhaps more current in peoples\u2019 minds than the dangers of warming, and historically people have been more worried about being too cold than too warm. The idea of an impending ice age did feature in some media pieces.\nHeadline from the Melbourne Age, February 16, 1979.\nThe role of the earth\u2019s orbit in climate (footnote 3) was being confirmed. These long-term changes in the distribution of solar radiation over the seasons and latitudes were discovered to be imprinted upon the record of climate, leading to the suggestion that, all else being equal, the earth might be headed towards an ice age. Some scientists did suggest another ice age might be on the way (footnote 4), but it was not clear when. It was known by then the earth was in an \u201cinterglacial\u201d stage, and these warm stages were relatively short excursions in the generally cool Pleistocene epoch (footnote 5).\nAnother \u201ccold climate\u201d worry came from the fear of \u201cnuclear winter,\u201d and also drove the development of climate models.\nSome commentators have seized upon statements like the latter as evidence there was a \u201cconsensus\u201d among scientists about a coming ice age. But actually there was not a clear sense which way the climate would go in the coming decades. Climate scientists were already aware of the potential of global warming from carbon dioxide emissions, but when and by how much would their influence be felt?\nBroecker predicted that by 2010 global temperatures would have risen 1.1 C (above a late 19th Century baseline) and atmospheric CO2 content would be at 403 ppm. Not bad.\nPioneers like Svante Arrhenius in the late 1800\u2019s and Mikhail Budyko (footnote 8) in the 1960s had already anticipated the warming effect of greenhouse gases, though they saw global warming as beneficial.\nClimate science has evolved. We now see the warming effects of accumulating greenhouse gases as a greater risk than global cooling. We also recognize a broader spectrum of impacts than warming alone, such as the acidification of the ocean due to its absorption of CO2.\nNew studies of climate variability have provided timely reminders that we need to be able to adapt to climate changes, no matter what drives them.\n1.

He is a visiting fellow at Australian National University Research School of Earth Sciences and the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania and is serving as the Deputy Chair of the Australian National Committee for Antarctic Research. Dr. Howard has a Ph.D in Geological Sciences from Brown University in the US. He was Postdoctoral Fellow at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, a lecturer in oceanography at the Sea Education Association in Woods Hole USA, a researcher at the Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre in Hobart, and Assistant Director, Science, at the Office of the Chief Scientist in Canberra. His current work is focused on developing an integrated approach to understanding and managing sedimentary basins and particularly their porespace. Competing uses of basins' subsurface spaces are crucial to agricultural productivity, energy, water and waste management, and to maintenance of ecosystems. He researches marine climate change, with emphasis on ocean acidification and its impacts on the past, current, and future ocean. He has focused on the ocean carbon cycle and responses of marine ecosystems to climate change, as well as insights into climate change from ocean sediment records as baselines for pre-industrial conditions and for understanding the impacts of future climate change.\nIn the 1970s, the first comprehensive analysis of oxygen isotopes in sediments from cores taken from the sea floor established for the first time that the timing of the Ice Ages was linked to subtle changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun as suggested long ago by Serbian mathematician Milutin Milankovitch. In the context of orbital changes with cycles of tens to hundreds of thousands of years, this meant that IF ALL ELSE REMAINED CONSTANT, Earth\u2019s climate would inevitably cool toward another Ice Age over the next 100,000 years or so.\nThis is still true, but 100,000 years is a very long time. Note that it\u2019s not at all inconsistent to expect very rapid warming over the next 300 years and still be at the beginning of a 100,000 year cooling trend due to orbital variations.\nMore to the point, we know quite well, just as we did in the 1970\u2019s that ALL ELSE IS NOT CONSTANT. In particular, we know that the rapid economic development in China and (soon) India will create an enormous increase int eh demand for energy, and that if this demand is met primarily through combustion of carbon that atmospheric CO2 will rise to between 3 and 4 times preindustrial concentrations. And we know in great quantitative detail how many Watts of outgoing heat this extra CO2 will absorb. And we know much better now than we did 40 years ago how sensitive the Earth\u2019s climate is to each Watt of absorbed heat.\nThe ironic thing is that the huge climate swings (Ice Ages) associated with subtle changes in Earth\u2019s orbit are the strongest evidence we have of the sensitive of Earth\u2019s climate in degrees per Watt. The fact that the ice melted at the end of the last Ice Age shows that if China and India industrialize with coal, the Earth\u2019s climate will warm a similar amount in response. After all, a Watt of extra heat from CO2 is the same as a Watt of extra heat from the Sun.\nThe fact of previous climate change due to \u201cnatural cycles\u201d is probably the strongest evidence we have that adding the same amount of heat will warm future climate about as much as the warming following the last Ice Age. The difference is that 5 Celsius of global warming after the last Ice Age took about 10,000 years, whereas politicians\u2019 Plan A is to add the same amount of heat over the next couple of centuries.\nThe great irony is that politicians and their cheerleaders (see Dr J on here) don\u2019t even understand the fundamental logical contradiction of their positions. The arrogance of big government indeed!\nScott, your comments are very pertinent. And perhaps an expanded future post could explore this issue in more detail.\nSome cite the Quaternary climate cycles as an example of \u201cthis has all happened before.\u201d The \u201clogical contradiction\u201d is that these cycles are a source of our understanding of the role of greenhouse gases as powerful feedbacks, and of other feedback processes (e.g. albedo, among other short- and long-time scale processes) that mediate subtle changes in the distribution of incoming solar radiation into large-scale climate changes. Our emissions of GHGs are taking what likely operated as a feedback during the Quaternary cycles and making it a primary forcing of the Earth\u2019s radiative balance (or imbalance in this case).\nThere is often misunderstanding of the effect of orbital cycles on the distribution of incoming solar radiation. The Croll-Milankovitch orbital cycles operate independently of changes in the Sun\u2019s output. What the orbital cycles mainly do is change the latitudinal and seasonal distribution of incoming solar energy. But, averaged over the year, or over the whole globe, there\u2019s little difference between \u201cice growth\u201d and \u201cice decay\u201d orbital geometries. In high orbital eccentricity geometries (varying in ~400,000 and ~100,000-year cycles), precessional (\u201cwobble\u201d) cycles (~23,000 year cycles) shift the season of perihelion.\nIn intervals in which the earth is farthest from the Sun in boreal summer, with low tilt, the \u201ccanonical\u201d C-M hypothesis would say there\u2019s more chance of high-latitude Northern Hemisphere snow cover persisting through summer.\nThe earth\u2019s orbital obliquity (tilt) varies on a ~ 40,000 year cycle between ~ 22 degrees from the ecliptic to ~ 25 degrees (it\u2019s now 23.5). In intervals of lower obliquity those high latitudes are not tilted towards the sun in summer as much as in high tilt intervals, creating a situation (in the C-M theory) conducive to summer persistence of snow cover. It is of course persistent and ongoing accumulation of snow that ultimately results in a glacier or ice sheet.\nThanks for the interesting post, Will.\nIt is sad that people who deliberately distort science have so much influence in politics and public media. The only good thing is that once warming of surface temperatures resumes, which I expect to happen soon, those people will all be completely discredited.\nPingback: Where does the albedo effect fit into the estimates of climate sensitivity (warming response)?","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/climatechangenationalforum.org\/fears-of-freezing-the-1970s-are-calling-they-want-their-climate-policies-back\/"}

{"text":"Traditionally, most colleges have had specific deadline dates for admissions applications. Recently though, many schools have begun to accept applications on an open or rolling basis, and this can be confusing for students who are used to more concrete requirements.\nBasically, a college utilizing rolling admissions will continue to accept applications for enrollment until space fills up in the class. The advantage is that they can continue to accept students later in to the year, but this doesn\u2019t mean that you should still wait until the last minute to get your paperwork turned in.\nWhile students can get accepted right up until registration for classes begins, there are still usually advantages to applying earlier. Many colleges provide institutional aid in the form of scholarships and grants, and these financial aid opportunities usually have a deadline date that comes long before the final day applications will be considered on a rolling basis. Federal financial aid is also distributed by the college or university, and those funds are typically exhausted in early spring.\nadmissions to get enrolled in another degree program.\nJohn is a writer and web publisher helping students find the right degree and money to pay for college. Education is more important than ever when it comes to employment and income, so consider a new degree today!\nPhotography Schools \u2013 Which One To Choose?\nThere is a lot of choice when it comes to places where you can learn photography, but which would be the best for you? For sure there are plenty of online learning resources, but you will not get that practical experience you need. You will learn a lot more being with other students and a good teacher. Having said that, online information is good at getting the basics down, and is a good place to start.\nWhat exactly you require from a photography class will help you decide which one to go for. For example, a college which is not just for photography will only offer basic levels. If you only intend taking up photography as a hobby then the basic levels of instruction will probably suffice.\nIf you really want to take your photography seriously you should go for a school or college which specializes in it. These specialized schools will probably employ a professional which should really help you learn the specifics and expand your know-how.\nYou must decide what it is you exactly want from your photography, once you have decided that you can choose your school or college and set about applying for a course. Do your online research and try to find any local courses or even courses further afield.\nYou may need to take specialized classes in basic disciplines such as lighting, composition and various other basic routines. Portrait photography, for example requires an understanding of light, angles, balances, and will teach you how to get the reactions you want from your subject. The digital photography world requires the understanding of several different techniques that were not required when using the older type of film camera.\nAs you get into it and really start learning all the ins and outs you may decide that you would like a career in photography. There is a lot of help both online and off-line if this is the path you choose.\nOne specialized area of photography is taking photographs under water. Most normal schools and colleges do not cater for this and you may have to do a bit of searching to find one which specializes in it. Underwater photography would make for a fascinating hobby or even better, a profession. To me, the underwater world is more interesting than the world above it.\nCollege is one of the best actions that people can take in order improve the quality of their lives. By going to college people not only increase their earning potential and employment opportunities; they also learn how to become more productive members of our society. The process for turning college students into high quality citizens begins in school. Here is a simple guide for students so that they can get the most out of their experience.\nStudents pay money to attend a university and this means that they should go to their classes. The college experience is ultimately about the education process over anything else. It\u2019s through this education process that a student is being prepared for the profession that they want to be involved in. So the best thing that any student can do is to show up for their class, be on time, and make sure they absolutely learn something.\nYou can\u2019t go to school without paying your tuition, well if we don\u2019t take scholarships and grants into consideration. Students who have to work to attend school should make it a point to pay for their expenses while attending. Again, this is because the education for your profession is the most important reason why you\u2019re there.\nBeing social in college is okay as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with your education. Many people get sidetracked in college because they allow the other aspects of the college life to get in the way of their main purpose for being there. Have a social life in college because it\u2019s a part of the process for you becoming a productive member of our society but don\u2019t allow this social life to get out of control.\nchanging because credit card debt is out of control in this country and one part of these changes has to do with college students and credit. The bottom line is students under the age of 21 won\u2019t be able to get a credit card unless they can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they can pay it off or if they have parents who can.\nThere are plenty more areas that can be covered for this simple college guide for students but the main thing to remember is that college is about your education and that education is what you will need in order to help you make a better life for your family and yourself.\nFind great student articles like this, and more of Tom\u2019s work all on his student blog.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/baycollegeplanners.wordpress.com\/tag\/classes\/"}

{"text":"All right, that\u2019s not *exactly* true. I\u2019m a writer. I always have words. But right now those words are coming out in a sputtering, expletive filled tirade. Why? Well, here. Go read this. I\u2019ll wait.\nAbout 13 months ago, I got a Kindle. Before that, my reading time was pretty limited. I carry a pretty heavy bag back and forth to work every day, so there simply wasn\u2019t much room for books and I read so fast that I would have often needed to bring 2 books with me at a time. Plus, I tend to flit between two books (say fiction and non-fiction) on the same bus ride, so that could even require up to 4 books in my bag. Not going to happen.\nBut then came the Kindle. Awesome. I started checking books out from the library. And then, a friend turned me on to The Emperor\u2019s Edge. \u201cIt\u2019s free!\u201d she said (for the first book). \u201cStrong female lead!\u201d she said. \u201cI think you\u2019d like it!\u201d she said. Strictly speaking, I don\u2019t think she used that many exclamation points, but the gist was the same.\nSo I tried it. Loved it. Seriously, by the time I was done I was in love with the characters and the story arc. I didn\u2019t even realize at the time that it was self-published. But I bought the next book in the series. Loved that too. Then I started following the author on Twitter. Then I started following other authors on Twitter. And within a couple of months, I had perhaps 50 different self-published books on my Kindle. Today, the number of self-published books on my Kindle well exceeds the number of traditionally published books on my Kindle.\nIs everything self-published great? Of course not. But have I enjoyed at least 95% of all self-published books I\u2019ve read in the past year? Yes. Without a doubt.\nSo to hear this\u2026 person\u2026 dismiss all indie writers as crap\u2026 well, it\u2019s enough for me to head to Smashwords and go on an indie author buying spree. I suppose in that respect, I should thank him. I\u2019ll probably end up with at least two or three new authors I can\u2019t wait to read.\nEdited to add: I really wanted to respond with a comment on this guy\u2019s blog. But I can\u2019t get past the irony of him posting that vitriol on a very poorly formatted blogger.com blog. Brown header text on a brown background? White sidebar headers on light brown backgrounds that are too big for the background image? I kid you not. Every time I try, I just start laughing at my desk.","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/www.pdeddy.com\/i-have-no-words\/"}
{"text":"When \u03ba, \u03b1 & I arrived at the car renting agency in Reykjavik to pick up our 4\u00d74, the 2 guys working there looked for a moment at how tiny we were.\nThey asked where we were heading with a doubtful question mark in their voice. We said that our ultimate goal was Dj\u00fapav\u00edk, a lost hamlet in the north west peninsula of Iceland. They gave us a bunch of instructions on how to drive on ice, on snow, on pebbles, on mountain roads. Feels like they were worried not to see the 4\u00d74 again.\nOff we were to northern adventures in OUR car. We stopped for a couple of nights on the way, visited an ice cream factory supported by volcano energy and adored the poetry of it.\nOn the last day of Winter (end of April for the Vikings), we stopped in Borgarnes where we were strongly recommended by a lady who was a huge fan of Paul Oscar (the Icelandic equivalent of\u2026 Peter Andre?) not to drive further up north. She showed us the official website of Icelandic roads, and most of them were closed due to weather conditions. She called Dj\u00fapav\u00edk hotel on our behalf to cancel our night.\nBut the trip wouldn\u2019t feel complete without seeing Dj\u00fapav\u00edk because we had been fantasising it since day 1. In only a few days, it had become our Mecca, the one place to see before you die.\nSo on the first day of Summer, we hit the road anyway.\nIt was the most intense journey we all ever lived. The more north we were getting, the more lost in white.\nNothingness and white. Sometimes after a curve, the insolent green of a far away fjord would blind us as if we had already forgotten about colour.\nAs the hours were passing, the road was getting narrower and whiter. The snow hadn\u2019t been cleared. We were directly overlooking the cliffs \u2013 no security barrier whatsoever. I can\u2019t remember how long this lasted, but it felt like a lifetime, another time\/space dimension. We were several hours without speaking at all, just all gathering our meditations not to die, to make it to the next bend, to the next bump on the road. To the safe.\nEverytime we were seeing a hut ahead, we were all secretly hoping: Dj\u00fapav\u00edk? But Dj\u00fapav\u00edk wasn\u2019t in sight.\nThere was a point that we lost hope to ever reach it. We thought of going backwards, we thought we got lost. We decided to carry on just a bit more.\nAnd there it was. No possible mistake.\nWe had reached our Mecca, our El Dorado, our enchanted land. It wouldn\u2019t have surprised us much to see unicorns drinking the water of the bay.\nWe cartwheeled on the snow and knocked the door of the hotel. A beautiful lady welcomed us: \u201cYour rooms are not ready, I wasn\u2019t expecting you.\u201d We were the only customers in the hotel, and the only living souls in Dj\u00fapav\u00edk along with the couple of owners and their dog Freya.\nThat\u2019s the happiest I\u2019ve ever been to arrive somewhere. That\u2019s the most desired destination I\u2019ve ever wanted to see with my own eyes.\nIt is not until months later that I talked about that journey again with \u03b1, and we both agreed that it was the closest to death we ever felt.\nBut God was it worth the risk.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/fuckyouirocktheworld.com\/2014\/08\/02\/djupavik-la-mecca\/?shared=email&msg=fail"}

{"text":"MY THOUGHTS ON EXOVATICANA BOOK. THERE WILL BE NO ET DISCLOSURE THIS YEAR.\nRecently I read the book by two American fundamentalists Christians Cris Putnam and Tom Horn called Exovaticana.\nThe book did create a certain amount of interest amongst the exopolitics community. The book was reviewed on Michael Salla,s exopolitics website and I heard was am Amazon best seller. However I personally found the book very disappointing to say the least.\nThe two authors of the book claimed to have discovered evidence that Pope Francis is going to announce a new extraterrestrial savour this year. However this I feel was the books major problem. The two authors did not as far as I could see after reading the book supply one piece of real evidence to back up their claim that the new Pope is going to make an announcement regarding extraterrestrials this year. The book written by two fundamentalist Christians was as far as I am concerned just five hundred pages of rants against mainstream protestant,catholic and orthodox Christians. So I found the book a great disappointment to say the least.\nNow I am convinced that there is a cover up regarding the existence of extraterrestrials. The uncovering of the 1964 Nato report by Colonel Bob Dean an American officer who served at the Nato headquarters in Brussels which confirmed Natos knowledge of extraterrestrial races confirms this.\nHowever the key point from this is that the worlds politicians have kept the existence of extraterrestrials secret for many years in the past. So sadly I expect them the keep the existence of extraterrestrials secret for many years to come.\nSo for any who reads the Exovaticana book I say sorry no ET disclosure this year.\nBLANK GENERATION NEEDS TO STAND UP AND FIGHT BACK.\nIn this blog I will explore the mass depoliticization amongst young people and will explain the need for a mass fight back against the corporate fascist financial dictatorship that runs the world.\nYoung people in both Europe, America and the rest of the world face a very grim future. High unemployment, high insecure rents to private landlords, huge student debts. Also the only work available is often temporary low paid casual jobs. This work situation also often applies to people with university degrees. So we have a generation with no future.\nHowever the paradox and contradiction to this grim situation is that we have probably the most apolitical and ill informed generation about politics for years. Young people just seem to talk about corporate sports and celebrity film stars showing very little interest in the fight back against the corporate system.\nWithout doubt this is as a result of a strategy pursued by the ruling elite to depoliticize young people by promoting their interest in fake entertainment and corporate rock and roll. However the question what needs to be asked is what can be done to awaken young people from their political slumbers and start fighting back against the corporate system.\nFirstly we need to build a new political movement in both Britain and the rest of the world that can build a fight back against corporate rule.\nSecondly those of us who are already opposed to the corporate system need to get busy carrying out propaganda amongst young people urging them to get involved in the political struggle.\nThirdly mass use of the new social media to carry out political agitation amongst young people against the corporate system and explaining a programme to build a new system.\nSo lets all get busy there is no time to lose.\nTHE START OF THE NEW ENGLISH SOCCER SEASON DON,T BECOME OBSESSED BY COMMERCIAL SPORT.\nThis Saturday 17\/8\/2013 the English league premier soccer season starts which signifies the full start of the English soccer season. Now as a person who used to be a big soccer fan in my younger days to be blunt the start of the new season is a big turn off.\nI would have to agree fully with both George Orwell and Noam Chomsky that global corporate sport particularly soccer helps to promote false consciousness amongst the masses. Soccer and other major sports are promoted by the ruling elites to take peoples minds of the worlds political and social problems and so depoliticise people.\nPersonally I find it very hard to understand how ordinary working class people earning \u00a325000.00 per year can look up to as heroes soccer stars earning \u00a3200000.00 per week. This is definitely false consciousness. Besides this I personally find the behaviour and attitude of soccer stars like Steve Terry and Luiz Suarez a big turn off.\nThe atmosphere in soccer was I feel different in the 1960,s and 1950,s soccer and other top sports were treated much less seriously. I remember England winning the world cup in 1966 was only backpage newspaper news not news headlines on the TV media as it is now. Players wages in the 1960,s were close to that of ordinary people. Also in the 1950,s and 1960,s non league soccer teams had a large following. There was not the instinct that you had to support one of the premiership teams.\nAs I have said earlier in this blog it is all part of the ruling elite strategy of depoliticising ordinary people and thus take their mind of their economic and social problems. This pacification of the masses will stop them taking part in the fight for economic and social change.\nIf you want to be a free minded person who does want to join the fight for economic and social change. Then disengage from the ruling class pacification process. Do not pay for sports channels. Also do not become obsessed by commercial sport and join the fight for human freedom,justice and liberation.\nPOPE FRANCIS THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS.\nPope Francis has been the Pope the head of the Catholic Church for nearly five months now. Being appointed on the 13\/3\/2013 to succeed Pope Benedict XVI. Although I personally feel that the Catholic Church is in need of major reforms I would concede that so far the positives outnumber the negatives in his papacy.\nThe one dark spot regarding his life has been his relationship towards the Argentine military junta of the 1970,s and 1980,s. However the Argentine Permanent Assembly of Human Rights have stated that there has been no link proven between Pope Francis and the Argentine military junta of the time. So obviously Pope Francis must be considered not guilty of any links to the Junta.\nHe has made a few encouraging speeches attacking global capitalism excesses. Also he has also called for a greater role for women in the church. He has also called for improved relationships with other Christian churches.\nThe leading liberation theologian Leonardo Boff has stated the he feels that Pope Francis does have some sympathy for liberation theology. However the former catholic priest Matthew Fox feels that Pope Francis is hostile to liberation theology. So clearly there are different points of views relating towards this subject.\nHowever so far the new Pope has made an encouraging start. However he needs to build on this by allowing married priests in the church, women priests or deacons. Also drop the churches opposition to artificial birth control. Finally the church should help develop an alternative economic system to capitalism and distance itself from the rich and powerful.\nIn this blog I will give some insights into the views of the controversial Episcopal priest Matthew Fox who joined the Episcopal church after being removed as a priest by the Catholic church in 1994.\nI have to state that some of his views I do agree with. I share his criticism regarding the Catholic church,s swing to the right under Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. Their opposition to married priests and the birth control pill and their alliance with the political right.\nI first came across Matthew Fox after reading his book The Popes War. It gives a very good account of Pope John Paul and Pope Benedicts attack on liberal elements in the Catholic Church and exposing the church,s support for right wing fascist politicians in Latin America. Matthew Fox seems to be a bitter man and he may have a good reason to be after being removed as a catholic priest for his liberal views.\nI totally agree with him that the church must go back to become the church before the Roman Empire took control of the church when Emperor Constantine became a Christian in the early fourth century. He is right in stating that the church should distance itself from the rich and powerful. However this should apply to orthodox and protestant churches as well.\nWhy in general I agree with most of what Matthew Fox says. I do have some queries on the Creation Spirituality movement that he has set up. This is to a certain extent a new age Christian church. Which uses techno masses and new age ceremonies. Personally I prefer the traditional church service although like Matthew I am a liberal who wants to distance the church from the rich and powerful. In Britain his Creation Spirituality movement is called Green Spirituality and does not seem totally Christian.\nSo in conclusion I would agree with Matthew Fox that the Christian churches need major reforms perhaps even a revolution. I do have some small queries about the Creation Spirituality network and what we really need a revival of liberation theology.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/kevinclarion.wordpress.com\/2013\/08\/"}

{"text":"We have established the tradition to every year give a topic to the Janmastami Festival. This year the theme was \"Krishna and His beloved peacocks\". Already last year at Kartik I bought beautiful peacocks of various sizes in Vrindavan, and devotees took them back to Kharkov. And our pujaris made more peacocks of all kinds. There were also other animals such as frogs, ducks, cows, lizzards, turtles, and also mushroms. And the Deities were receiving a new outfit with peacocks. It was a wonderful absorption to make all these arrangements, and the devotees were fascinated, allowing their eyes and minds to wander and discover all the little details. It was indeed a window into Goloka Vrindavan......!\nEvery evening during the days leading up to Janmastami Deena Bandhu Prabhu gave Vraja lila Katha, decorated with wonderful Vraja bhajans and kirtans. He truly brought Vrindavan to us all, and devotees were charmed by his sweet personality. Having lived for so many years in Vrindavan, he deeply carries Vrindavan in his heart and serves like a touch stone, transforming every place into Vrindavan. For so many years he has been sacrificing his very body in taking the devotees on parikrama around Vrindavan, introducing them to Krishna's pastime places. What a wonderful way to serve the Vaisnavas!\nOn the morning of Janmastami Deena Bandhu Prabhu gave the morning program, which was well attended considering it was a working day. There was further katha by senior devotees and readings with kirtan throughout the whole day. At 4pm we witnessed a beautifully arranged abhishek conducted by the pujaris on the altar, accompanied by melodious kirtan. Thereafter Deena Bandhu Prabhu gave a wonderful lecture, describing all kinds of sweet details around Krishna's appearance. We continued with Gaur Artik, followed by offering of gifts and cards to the Lord, and Deena Bandhu Prabhu singing more Vraja Bhajans. A group of matajis offered a poetic presentation as a little cultural program, and then we all received the opportunity to swing Radha Syamasundara, accompanied by sweet kirtans - another opportunity to chant the holy name in a prayerful mood.\nThe last hour before midnight I conducted our traditional \"Krishna Meditation\" connected with this year's theme - Krishna and His beloved peacocks. I had collected nice quotes from the Bhagavatam, describing games and pastimes with Krishna and the cowherd boys, in connection with peacocks.\n\"O friend, Vrindavana is spreading the glory of the earth, having obtained the treasure of the lotus feet of Krishna, the son of Devaki. The peacocks dance madly when they hear Govinda's flute, and when other creatures see them from the hilltops, they all become stunned.\nSrila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains Krishna-Lila as follows: \"In Vrindavana, the peacocks request Krishna, 'Govinda, please make us dance.' Thus Krishna plays His flute, and they surround Him in a circle and dance in time with the rhythm of His melody. And while standing in the midst of their dancing, He also sings and dances. Then those peacocks, who are fully satisfied with His musical performance, out of gratitude offer for His pleasure their own divine feathers. In the usual manner of musical performers, Krishna gladly accepts these presentations and places a feather upon the turban atop His head. Gentle animals such as deer and doves greatly relish the transcendental entertainment presented by Krishna, and to get a good view they flock to the peaks of hills. Then, as they watch the breathtaking program, they become stunned in ecstasy.\"\nWe were reading from Sivarama Swami's book \"Venu Gita\", which gives very detailed descriptions of this very astounding pastime - the peacocks were shedding tears of ecstasy when Krishna joined their dancing. The flute in Krishna's hands, seeing the uncommon performance of its master and the peacocks, began to sing of its own accord. This exceptional development greatly surprised even Krishna, who watched as, without His effort, the flute played in response to the dancing of the birds. All the animals assembled to witness this unique kirtan performance and were stunned in ecstatic love. Finally the king of peacocks approached Krishna in a mood of great humility. Bowing low to the ground, he said: \"Dear Krishna, we are lowly creatures of the forest and, having no possessions, we live in the trees and eat whatever flowers and herbs are available in season. In making us dance, You have created a great festival of bliss, for which we remain eternally in Your debt. Despite our poverty, it is our duty to offer You daksina, failing to do which we would appear ungrateful and lose our reputation. Therefore, I request You to accept our only opulence, the feathers of our plumage, and wear them in Your crown as its decoration.\" With large tears of ecstasy flowing down his beak, the leader of peacocks dropped many divine feathers at Govinda's lotus feet.\nKrishna accepted the offerings of the peacocks and, while gathering their feathers, He fondly caressed their heads, to everyone's great joy. He placed a few feathers in His turban and, while holding the rest in His hand, He turned to His friends, who embraced Him with love and affection.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.therootsofspiritualculture.net\/diary\/janmastami-and-prabhupadas-appearance"}
{"text":"Laurie: As a kid, I always enjoyed dressing up in more 'boyish' clothes. I loved my Star Wars figures, and hated Barbie dolls. I wore boys Under-roos (Superman was my favorite!) and played sports.\nDustin: This photo was taken somewhere in the wild back country of Wyoming on the annual fall hunting trip with the family. I can't believe I used to go hunting - definitely not something I'd do today. I used to love putting on that great orange gear - the best was the shopping trip prior to the hunt where I could pick out anything as long as it was orange. We shot all sorts of guns - mostly at Coke cans. I only remember once when a deer was actually killed. I just can't believe that when this photo was taken that my family didn't know I was gay. Look at the pose! The hips, the knees, the hand gesture and yes, the gun. How could they be so shocked when I came out?! I always knew I was gay - I never had a problem with it. I just knew one day I'd be a grown-up and fabulous. And I was RIGHT!\n\u2026some of the pix here feature gay boys with feminine traits, and some gay girls with masculine traits. And even more gay kids with NONE of those traits. Just like real life, these gay kids come in all shades and layers of masculine and feminine\u2026 this project is not about furthering stereotypes.

{"text":"This website is dedicated to preserving the history of Mayoffs around the world, and providing news and entertainment for our extended family and friends.\nIn the mid-1980\u2019s Art Mayoff, of Benicia, California, began his quest for information about his heritage and lineage. Online research and interviews with family members that he knew led to a growing network of contacts. Each contact provided additional information more contacts. Relatives were discovered around the world. Variations in the spelling of our name were documented. Through years of research and detective work, Art was able to develop an extensive family tree of his entire generation and many descendants, and taking our paternal lineage back three generations to approximately 1800 in Russia. That family tree also includes a brief history.\nIn the fall of 1993 Art produced his first printed newsletter and named it The Family Descendant. Distribution of the newsletter led to growth in the Mayoff network, stories and pictures for the newsletter, and several international reunions. The newsletter continued publication through the summer of 1990. Family members may view all of the newsletters in the Family Only section of this website \u2014 a password is required.\nArt\u2019s cousin, Bernie Mayoff became a frequent contributor to the newsletter. As Art transitioned from printed media to a website, Bernie continued his role as a contributor and also as an editor. As the inflow of new material slowed down, reports about the annual Mayoff Day celebrations became a major source for updates to the website. With changes in technology, Bernie and Art switched roles, with Bernie maintaining and operating the website and Art continuing as adviser.\nOther responsibilities have led to a freeze in the genealogy and family tree that Art built. The document is available in the Family Only section of this website. A volunteer to take over maintenance of this family tree would be welcome.\nA more limited family tree in pdf format, focused on the ancestors and descendants of the family of Bernie and Denise Mayoff, is also accessible through the Family Only section of this website.","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/mayoff.com\/home-2\/about\/"}

{"text":"Similar to Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux\u2019s grand ideas for Central Park, there is a vision for the 2,200 acres of reclaimed land at the former Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island. Where trash once piled up for as far as the eye could see, the site is now a blossoming park full of wildlife and recreational activities.\nThe Park Administrator overseeing this incredible transformation is Eloise Hirsh. Eloise is a major force behind the largest landfill-to-park conversion in the world to date. In her role as Freshkills Park Administrator, she makes sure the park progresses towards its completion date in 2035, and regularly engages with New Yorkers to keep them informed and excited.\n6sqft recently spoke with Eloise to learn more about Fresh Kills\u2019 history, what it takes to reclaim land, and what New Yorkers can expect at the park today and in the years to come.\nMost New Yorkers know Fresh Kills was once a landfill, but how it became one is often not discussed. Can you share a bit about its history?\nEloise: This section of western Staten Island was originally salt marsh and wetlands. Around the turn of the century, the borough was basically rural, and the western section was a site of small manufacturing with brick and linoleum makers. Robert Moses, New York\u2019s master planner, had the idea of filling all this acreage with landfill because the city was growing and had a garbage problem. People had a very different concept of wetlands before 1950. They thought of them as places of pestilence and mosquito breeding. They didn\u2019t understand their role as we have come to understand today, and instead thought they had to get rid of them.\nMoses said the city would fill the area for two to five years, and then he had a plan for residential development on the east side of what is now the Staten Island Expressway and light industry on the west side. However, five years turned into ten, ten to 20, and 20 to 50, until finally all of New York City\u2019s garbage was coming to Fresh Kills Landfill.\nThere used to be landfills all over the city, and parks and buildings were built on many of them. Flushing Meadows Park was a landfill, as was Pelham Bay Park and lots of coastline around Manhattan and Brooklyn. As the regulations got more stringent in the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s, the city decided to make a major investment to meet the regulations at Fresh Kills, and they gradually closed down the other landfills around the city. In the 90\u2019s, Fresh Kills was a state-of-the-art engineered site; it met all the environmental protection regulations.\nWhy did the city decide to close the site?\nEloise: As you can imagine, the residents of Staten Island hated it, and they protested for years. It finally happened when there was both a Republican mayor and governor at the same time. A state law was passed in 1996 that required the Fresh Kills Landfill to cease accepting solid waste by December 31, 2001. In March 2001, the landfill accepted its last barge of garbage.\nWhy did the city decide to develop a plan to transform Fresh Kills into a park?\nEloise: When the closure was announced, Kent Barwick, who was the director of the Municipal Arts Society of New York at the time, went to then Mayor Rudi Giuliani and told him that this is the last time the city is going to get this much open land. An international competition was held, and architecture and landscape architecture firms from around the world entered. The competition was won by James Corner Field Operations as their first big project. From 2003 to 2006, the firm, in conjunction with the Department of City Planning, got lots of ideas about what the park should be. This master planning process yielded a Draft Master Plan in 2006. At that point, Michael Bloomberg was Mayor, and he gave the job of implementing that plan to the Parks Department.\nDoes the Draft Master plan allow for changes as the project moves along?\nEloise: When the Draft Master Plan was developed, not everyone understood all the systems that were required and regulations that had to be followed. We are making changes as we go along for technical reasons and as community interest changes. People thought about tennis courts in the beginning, but now everyone wants soccer fields. Inevitably, something that takes this long will change gradually. We think of it as a guidepost; it gives everybody a general concept of what the park can be.\nWhat was the ecological impact of the landfill?\nEloise: Most of the wetlands and marshy areas in between were filled, but the major waterways still exist. In fact, there is a stream that goes throughout the site. A way to describe what happened to the land is by discussing what\u2019s coming back now. The thing that people most remember about Fresh Kills is what it smelled like. Now, it is 2,200 acres of extraordinarily beautiful landscape with hills and waterways going through. The wildlife has returned, and there are all kinds of birds, deer, groundhogs, and foxes.\nThis area of western Staten Island has a clay base, which is pretty impermeable soil, so there is a reduction in pollutants leaking. The Department of Sanitation placed containment walls around the landfill to prevent pollutants from leaking to adjacent areas.\nWhat does the process of reclaiming land involve?\nEloise: First, it requires managing the two products that landfills make: leachate, the liquid that percolates through the decomposing trash and settles at the bottom, and landfill gas, half of which is methane. There are two state-of-the-art systems in place to manage both of those products. The leachate is collected through a series of pipes and transportation systems, and then is taken to a processing plant on site where the liquid is cleaned and the water purified. The solids are then sent to a different landfill, but not a toxic waste landfill. The gas is also processed at a plant on site. The methane goes directly into National Grid\u2019s pipeline. The city makes money off it, and National Grid gets enough to heat about 20,000 homes on Staten Island. It\u2019s a renewable energy process.\nThen there is the covering system, which is a series of layers of different soils, geotextiles, and impermeable plastic, which is very thick and seals the trash. So, between the trash and the public there is an impermeable layer and two-and-a-half feet of very clean soil. The third part of reclaiming land is to manage the storm water. That requires engineering slops, which is what the Department of Sanitation has done. People come from all over the world to see this state-of-the-art process and what has to happen in order to reuse this much land.\nHow did you get involved in the reclamation project?\nEloise: This is my second time around in the Parks Department. During the Koch administration when Gordon Bay was the Parks Commissioner, I was First Deputy Commissioner. That was terrific and I loved it, but then I moved with my husband to Pittsburgh where I was the Director of City Planning. There, I worked on a lot of former industrial sites to turn them into urban amenities. When we came back to New York nine years ago, I heard about this project. It sounded like a good extension of my experience in Pittsburgh, and I thought it would be really incredible to work on it.\nAs Freshkills Park Administrator, what does your job entail?\nEloise: A big part of my job is to keep clear on the mission to make this park beautiful, accessible, and a unique experience for New Yorkers that demonstrates all aspects of sustainability and makes them think about recycling on the biggest possible level. I keep the project moving through all the inevitable roadblocks that come our way. Another important piece of my work is reaching out and building support for this very big project. The Freshkills Park Alliance is supporting our work to bring the park to the public in as many ways as we can, even before it\u2019s open. I work closely with them, making sure our team is doing everything we can to grow the audience for this incredible regional asset.\nThis is a very complicated project that involves many city and state agencies. On the city side, there is the Parks Department and Department of Sanitation. There is also Environmental Protection, City Planning, Department of Transportation, and Design and Construction. On the state side, there is the Department of Environmental Conservation as well as State Parks, Department of State, and State Transportation. All these agencies control some aspect of what we are doing at Freshkills Park.\nWhat is the role of Freshkills Park Alliance?\nEloise: The Alliance\u2019s goal is to raise money, guide programing, and develop a scientific agenda. We plan events and education programs that make the park accessible as it\u2019s being developed and support the scientific research that we want to have here. One of our hopes for the site is for it to be a place where we can demonstrate the ways you can deal with recovering damaged land.\nHow will this park change Staten Island?\nWhat are some of the unique recreational activities the park currently offers and hopes to offer in the future?\nEloise: We have a park and playground at the western end. We have soccer fields, and teams play there from 8:00 in the morning to 10:00 at night. One thing that is really unique is the expansiveness of the site. It\u2019s almost three times the size of Central Park. Because of the topography, when you are up on these hills you get an incredible feeling. You could be in Wyoming, except you see New Jersey. We do offer hiking, and some day people will be able to wander on what looks like moors in Ireland. In the future, there may even be an opportunity for skiing.\nI think people are starting to realize it\u2019s real, which is exactly why having our sneak peak event on September 28th is so important. It allows us to open up the park and let people come and see its future. It\u2019s why we have races, kayaks, and tours throughout the year. We want to make the site real to people and change their perception.\nWhat has being involved in this project meant to you?\nEloise: It\u2019s an incredible opportunity to be part of sustainability work. A very wonderful part of that work is my team. Everybody is so interested and driven by repurposing land, their personal responsibility for waste, and the opportunity to design this park. For me, it\u2019s a joy to come to work with people who are so excited. Being part of something that has that energy and mission is quite wonderful.\nThis Sunday, September 28th is Sneak \u2018Peak\u2019: Greenway Adventure at Freshkills Park. The public is invited to visit the park and participate in activities including kayaking, biking, and walking tours.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.6sqft.com\/new-yorker-spotlight-eloise-hirsh-on-reclaiming-freshkills-and-developing-a-park\/"}

{"text":"With so many good deals around it is often difficult to know when to pull the trigger on a deal. What happens if something better comes along? In this article, we will look at what the target prices are currently for flights to various destinations and what else makes a flight a good deal. The prices quoted are not the cheapest you will find them, but the cheapest prices you see regularly in a sale or promotion and ones I would be happy to pay.\nWhen choosing a flight the price is only one factor, so what else do I look at before I buy a flight?\nIf you are going to fly ex EU you need to take into account things such as: how much the positioning flights would be, how long it will take to get to the start point, will you need to stay overnight and if so how much will that cost. If you choose a difficult starting point, it can negate the savings of the ex EU fare with the extra costs such as flights and hotels. It can also add to the travel time substantially.\nIf I saw a deal that was cheap, one of the first things I would look at is the business class seat, food and service. If the price is good but they have old seats in a 2-2-2 configuration and bad food reviews, I am not going to fly with them no matter how cheap!\nI have status in three airline schemes currently so I will always be considering how to maintain status in those. If there is an opportunity to earn a substantial amount of miles or status on a fare then I don\u2019t mind paying a little extra. You can work out the Avios and Tier points for BA using this calculator. Don\u2019t forget that indirect flights will usually get more miles and points than direct.\nHong Kong \u2013 \u00a31400 Swiss from UK, Stockholm\/Oslo\/Gothenburg on Qatar.\nBeing so far away, these naturally can be very expensive and an average price on premium airlines is around \u00a33000-3600 from the UK. If you want to fly from the UK, then the cheapest deal on a decent airline is usually with China Southern which you can read a review of here. Their prices from the UK are often around \u00a32200-2400 which is a good price from the UK.\nIf you want to fly oneworld then your best bet will be to fly from Scandinavia usually. For example, there was recently a deal to Australia on Cathay Pacific from Stockholm for around \u00a31900. In a sale, Qatar often have prices of around \u00a32000-2200 to both Australia and New Zealand.\nSingapore Airlines regularly have a deal to Australia and New Zealand from Stockholm at around \u00a32100. You can read my reviews of our flights to New Zealand here.\nAir China have regular sales from the UK and Germany which can have fares as low as \u00a31500 from Germany. Black Friday in November is a good time for these to appear.\nAmerica consistently has some great value fares due to the amount of competition. Unless you are in urgent need of booking, it is never normally long until the next good deal.\nEast Coast (New York, Boston, Washington etc) \u00a31000. BA from Dublin or Amsterdam. TAP Air Portugal from the UK, Virgin from Dublin or Amsterdam. BA from London in a sale very occasionally but usually around \u00a31300.\nMiami \u2013 \u00a31100. BA from Stockholm, TAP from London. Slightly more from Amsterdam or Dublin with BAWest Coast \u2013 \u00a31200-1400 BA from Dublin or Amsterdam, Virgin from Dublin, Star Alliance from Dublin or Amsterdam.\nSao Paolo and Rio De Janeiro \u2013 \u00a31100 on LATAM from Amsterdam. Occasionally around \u00a31300 from UK. \u00a31800 in a sale from London with BA. Swiss from UK \u00a31400.\nCape Town \u2013 \u00a31200 from Amsterdam. Occasional deals around \u00a31300-500 from Scandinavia and Eastern Europe with Qatar.\n11 Comments on \"What should you pay for your business class flight?\"\nThis is a really useful guide, thank you.\nThis is great, thanks for share.\nAny good route and price guide to mainland China to recommend? PVG or CAN for example.\nI will add that in shortly.\nYes, thanks for the guide. One additional consideration with ex-EU flights, especially if the departure point is further away (and more expensive to reach from the UK)is the frequency and cost of positioning flight options. On the return, if your long-haul inbound was delayed, what are the consequences for your return positioning flight?\nGreat article, Michelle, very useful and informative, Thanks very much.\nIn 2017 my wife and I managed to bag a deal to Sydney with Malaysian airlines from LHR for \u00a31500 each in Business via Expedia. The catch (if you can call it a catch) was that you had to book a hotel room as well to get the good deal. We stayed in a hotel at Sydney airport for one night on arrival before flying on to Brisbane the next day so all worked out very well. I don\u2019t think I will see a deal like that for a long time\u2026.\nThank you, very useful guide.\nI am only recently getting used to flying business class and use Turning Left for less for advice etc. I flew to Bangkok from Amsterdam in November 2018, The day before I flew with BA from LHR to Amsterdam, stayed overnight in an airport hotel, then flew from Amsterdam to Bangkok (via LHR), on my return journey, when I checked in with BA at Bangkok I asked if I could leave the plane at LHR instead of flying all the way to Amsterdam (I had booked another hotel at Amsterdam airport to then fly back to LHR the following day) This was not a problem and my wife and I got off at Heathrow instead of having to complete the journey back to Amsterdam. \u2013 The downside was that I had pre-booked a hotel in Amsterdam and had a flight back from Amsterdam to London that I had to cancel (And didn\u2019t get any money back) \u2013 But even with that I still saved money in the long run by \u2013 it would have cost me a lot more had I booked to fly from Heathrow to Bangkok business class return!\nDon\u2019t understand the dislike of 2x2x2 business class. You get a huge amount of leg room and big comfortable armchair seats and you get to chat to someone over a drink and a meal and never fail to learn something. I\u2019ve occasionally had a miserable so and so next to me who could hardly muster a grunt but it\u2019s rare. And if you really want to be left alone you could get lucky and end up with both seats on lightly loaded flights and have a vast amount of space.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.turningleftforless.com\/what-should-you-pay-for-your-business-class-flight\/"}

{"text":"Lough Ree Distillery will be one of the easiest places in Ireland to give directions to when assisting a tourist or visitor to Ireland. See the big lake in the very centre of Ireland? That\u2019s Lough Ree or Loch R\u00ed in Irish, meaning The Lake of Kings.\nLanesborough town is the second easiest place in Ireland to give directions to. See the town at the Northern mouth of Lough Ree? That\u2019s Lanesborough!\nLanesborough is one of a few natural fords or crossing points on the might Shannon. Although there has been a bridge at Lanesborough for over 1,000 years, the very first crossing method was by stepping stones. The Irish name for Lanesborough, throughh Liag means Ford (throughh) of the Stones (Liag). To this day, the neighbouring village just across the bridge from Lanesborough is still known as Beal \u00c1tha Liag (the Mouth of the Ford of Stones) or in english form, Ballyleague.\nLough Ree is one of two large lakes along the River Shannon, which at 252 Kms length from source in Lough Allen to estuary at Limerick City is the largest river in the British Isles. It\u2019s a river that I know quite well as in 1992, I skippered the first boat ever to travel from top to bottom of the river in a day on the \u201cShannon Sprint Powerboat Record\u201d attempt. We completed the challenge in 4 hours and 58 minutes. But that\u2019s another story for another day!\nOne hundred and eighty years ago, at the height of whiskey distillery development in Ireland and before the popularity and expansion of Irish railway lines, the River Shannon served as a key shipping route running North-South along the central spine of Ireland from Limerick Sea Port to Northern Ireland. Two man made canals (the Royal and Grand canals) connected Dublin to the River Shannon at Tarmonbarry 10 Km North of Lough Ree and at Shannon Harbour, 25 Kms South of Lough Ree.\nFrom the 1820\u2019s to the 1900\u2019s, these inland waterways steamship routes played a major role in distributing Irish Whiskey from distilleries in Dublin, Tullamore and Monasterevin down along the River Shannon for export through Limerick Port to America and Britain.\nThe Dublin based National Newspaper \u201cSaunders Newsletter\u201d announced the introduction of boats from the Shannon using the new canal to Dublin in their edition of 2nd February 1818. Steamships followed shortly after.\nWhen you look at the archives for details of cargo carried up and sown the Shannon River in 1847, it is interesting to note that 742,000 litres of wines and spirits traveled down the Shannon to Limerick Port for export, whereas just 24,000 litres were embarked in Limerick for transportation and distribution up the Shannon to Irish consumers. As even then Ireland was not known for its wine production, we can safely assume that the 742,000 litres for export were all spirits and most likely, whiskey. These were shipped down the river to Limerick from distilleries including Knockcrochery and Athlone on Lough Ree and Killaloe on Lough Derg, the Shannon River\u2019s Southern Lake.\nIt\u2019s well over one hundred years since Irish Whiskey was last distilled on Lough Ree, but all that is about to change with the launch of the new Lough Ree Distillery which will open in Lanesborough in early 2019.\nThe owners of Lough Ree Distillery are the Lanesborough born Clancy Family \u2013 brothers and sister team. Sheila Clancy has a professional background in finance and hospitality management. Peter and Michael have professional backgrounds in engineering. All three have strong backgrounds in Project Management, Sales and Marketing and Management Consulting. As Irish agent for Barison Distillery Systems from Italy, Peter Clancy has also been involved in the design and commissioning of some of Ireland\u2019s latest small and medium Distillery projects.\nLough Ree Distillery have also retained the expertise of one of Ireland\u2019s leading whiskey retailers, Ally Alpine of The Celtic Whiskey Shop in Dublin who serves as a non executive Director on the Board.\nThe Team leading Lough Ree Distillery. Sheila, Peter and Michael Clancy.\nAt a press launch in Dublin last week, the Clancy Family shared details of their plan to build a \u20ac5M Irish Whiskey Distillery and Visitor Centre in their native Lanesborough, right beside the River Shannon.\nThe new distillery will be located in an old Georgian building just 50 m from the River Shannon. The house was built in 1806, so it would also have witnessed the comings and goings of the \u201cLanesborough Trader\u201d. Who knows? Lough Ree Distillery might even dedicate a room or window in their new distillery to that pioneering Shannon ship.\nPhase one of the project will see the launch of the Lough Ree whiskey visitor Centre in Q4 \u2013 2018 to Q1 \u2013 2019. Phase two in 2019 will see the distillery fully commissioned and producing Single Malt and Single Pot Still Irish Whiskeys, Gin, Vodka, Poitin and a range of Fruit Spirits and Liquors.\nArchitect\u2019s Drawing. Lough Ree Distillery and Visitor Centre.\nPeter Clancy also announced details of a very innovative Lough Distillery \u201cAmbassador\u201d programme which allows early investors to invest in the distillery in return for one to five casks of Irish Whiskey. The innovative element is that the investor can bottle 2 or more cases (12 bottles) a year from their cask once it has reached legal maturity at three years of age. There are three investment levels ranging from \u20ac6,000, through \u20ac8,000 to \u20ac48,000.\nThe lower two plans allow one cask per investor and 5 to seven years of maturation, while the top plan allows five casks per investor and ten years maturation.\nIn addition, the top \u201cR\u00ed\u201d Ambassador plan allows the investor to work one to one with the Lough Ree Master Distiller to create their own mash bill and cuts as well as selecting their own personal cask finish subject to cask availability.\nEffectively you can create and develop up to 5 casks (1,000 litres) of your own personal whiskey expression from Grain to Glass over ten years. When you divide the up-front investment by ten years of whiskey fun, it looks much more attractive for those who can afford it.\nIrish Whiskey Trail Editor Stuart McNamara and Peter Clancy CEO Lough Ree Distillery.\nThis is an impressive and well designed project led by a highly committed and experienced leadership team. It is also a most welcome addition to tourism in the Irish Heartlands, Irish Lakelands and Inland Waterways of Ireland.\nIt will be wonderful once more to see Irish Whiskey products leave a distillery on Lough Ree for export around the world.\nA notable feature of the recent Irish Whiskey renaissance is that many new distilleries including Lough Ree Distillery are incorporating strong whiskey tourism elements in their design. While distilleries make money for the whiskey brand owners, whiskey tourism makes many multiples of that amount for the local community hosting the distillery.\nSome of the new distilleries planned along the Wild Atlantic Way such as Portmagee Distillery in Kerry and Sliabh League Distillery in Donegal have significant potential as sticky, all year around tourism attractions.\nTourists drive along the Wild Atlantic Way, but they stop, stay and spend in the vicinity of whiskey distilleries adding hundreds of thousands and even millions each year to local tourism economies.\nI look forward to following Lough Ree Distillery\u2019s progress and welcoming them as members of the Irish Whiskey Trail in due course!\nFor further details, see the Lough Ree Distillery website.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/irishwhiskey.com\/lough-ree-distillery\/"}

{"text":"When I first walked into Paul Chamberlain\u2019s office three years ago, I was struck by the abundance of souvenirs on the bookshelves that line the walls. They\u2019re filled with everything from miniature Moroccan \u201ctagine\u201d dishes to ornate Tibetan prayer scrolls to a Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 glass from Sydney, Australia. Mixed among the old chemistry textbooks from Paul\u2019s years of teaching are dozens of Lonely Planet travel guides from cities and countries all over the world. On the wall are pictures of sunburned, beaming students on white sand beaches, as well as old photos of George Fox science faculty.\nThere are stories behind everything in the office, and Paul\u2019s good at telling them. I recently asked about a photo on his wall and was regaled with a story about the time Paul\u2019s entire Juniors Abroad group got massages on a beach in Zanzibar. Paul laughed as he told the story, his eyes twinkling behind his wire-rim glasses.\nHe says he has too many favorite stories to count, but he\u2019s pleased to share them with anyone who asks. I\u2019ve been working for Paul for years, and every time I walk through his door to ask him to sign a document for a student or to ask his opinion on a flier I\u2019m working on, he\u2019s happy to tell the stories and share memories of his travels.\nPaul\u2019s office is a reflection of his time at George Fox University. Starting as an organic chemistry professor in 1976, he\u2019s been in charge of coordinating all of the university\u2019s Juniors Abroad trips since he took over as director of the program 20 years ago. He eventually became director of the Center for Study Abroad in 2014, when Juniors Abroad and the semester abroad office joined together. The office has changed significantly over the last four years: His old chemistry books have started gathering dust as the shiny new travel guides take over the shelves.\nPaul\u2019s work at the Center for Study Abroad led to the growth of many of the programs offered. \u201cWhen we took over there were 26 students per year who studied abroad due to budget limitations,\u201d Paul says. Now there are close to 60 a year \u2013 and many pay the same to study abroad as they do for a semester at George Fox. Paul hopes to see even more students studying abroad in the years to come \u2013 a goal that seems attainable as application numbers continue to rise.\n\u201cEmbracing different cultures takes on a whole new meaning when you are physically in those cultures,\u201d says student Bailey Sauls. This sentiment is echoed in other students\u2019 statements and stories. Both Cayla Smith and Hannah Love say they are much more likely to travel after their experience on Juniors Abroad, and that Paul\u2019s attitude and stories have impacted the way they think about international travel. \u201c[Juniors Abroad] made me want to go seek out every other country in the world and see what amazing things they have to offer,\u201d Cayla says.\nPaul\u2019s expertise and enthusiasm have impacted many George Fox students over the years, and I am glad that I\u2019ve been one of them. Paul values traveling and studying abroad, something that has already greatly impacted my life. The chance to experience other cultures has changed the way I think about my own culture and about my place in the world.\nI\u2019m grateful to attend a university that promotes international experiences; I\u2019m also grateful that George Fox has hired Paul to run the Center for Study Abroad. He hopes to make international travel accessible to more students, allowing more people to be changed by the world before they change the world themselves.\nSomeday, there will be a generation of George Fox alumni whose bookshelves also have souvenirs from around the world \u2013 all thanks to Paul Chamberlain.\nThe epiphany happened early in my teaching career, during a spring semester finals week. As a thank you for being my assistant for several years, I took a graduating senior to lunch, and together we talked about her experience at George Fox University. Even though Rose was a wicked-smart student, an academic success, one of the best assistants I\u2019d ever have, and a talented singer and actor in musical theatre, she admitted during our lunch that she felt like she was graduating a failure. Her reasoning? She hadn\u2019t found \u201dThe One\u201d to whom she could commit life-long marital fidelity.\nLate night, in a dark room with a bright screen, he sits with the light bouncing off of his eyes. He wipes his hands over his face trying to shake off the tiredness and ignore the call of the bed, where his wife is fast asleep. It\u2019s just another late night before an early morning, one in a long string of days that lead him toward his goal at a sloth-like pace. Sleep must be sacrificed. Sacrifice is something he is used to, though this one is different. This one is for him.\nPatrick Walsh graduated from George Fox\u2019s Adult Degree Program at the age of 50 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in management and organizational leadership. The scene above is a small part of his college experience. His path reminds us that the journey of students is as unique as the students themselves. These journeys are filled with obstacles, detours, ups and downs, sacrifices and many late nights.\nCambria Herrera sits back in her chair. Listening, thinking. Her arms and legs are crossed as she watches the scene in front of her unfold, pauses and all. Her eyes move from actor to actor, then stare out into the rehearsal room. Every once in a while, a slight smile appears on her face, then fades before reappearing.\nShe\u2019s also 20 years old.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/blogs.georgefox.edu\/bruinblog\/?author=19"}
{"text":"This story comes courtesy of one of my friends. Enjoy!\nI think the best place for ghost hunting would have to be my college. I have a few friends who have varying levels of the sixth sense and the paranormal activity is sometimes so strong it can be sensed in the day when students, teachers, and cars are passing by. It's pretty cool, if you're into that sort of thing.\nThe best example of how haunted it is would be the ghost hunt my friends and I did a night before this year's Halloween, October 30th. We started at 10:30pm, a group of four: I, my boyfriend, Jane, and John (names excluded and substituted for privacy). I am, admittedly, not very tuned to the supernatural. I have picked up smells and sounds, but that's about it. My boyfriend is much more active, he can sense heat\/cold, and can generate a lot of spiritual energy that attracts a great amount of ghosts, which gets him in a lot of trouble sometimes. Jane is able to obtain residual memories, memories of past events, by getting in contact with the ghosts. In this way she can pick up on emotions, age, names, dates, etc. John was in the same boat as me, an open-minded observer.\nOur destination was Holmdene, the reputed most-haunted building on campus. That night we sensed five spirits, six if you count the terrier, which was the first spirit. Next was the boy who drowned in the pond by Holmdene. His name was Michael. We were using the pendulum method with my car keys, which worked the last time we encountered him, but he ran after the first couple of questions. Looking back, this seems rather foreboding of what was to come.\nBy this time Jane was being pulled towards the side of the building, to one of the windows. She sensed a maid standing by the window, and the woman was scared. Jane said it was as if something bad was going on past the window, in the meeting room, and the maid was scared of the outcome. My boyfriend got a chill and Jane told us that the maid was pushing us back, as if to protect us from what was going on in the room. So we left to walk around to the back of Holmdene.\nBy the corner Jane found a butler standing stationary, probably smoking a cigarette, she said. My boyfriend also sensed him, slightly cold neutrality. The butler did not care about us, both of them said.\nSometime during this incident, I heard faint music, as if it was coming out of an old-fashioned record player, you know, the one with a horn? It didn't really scare me at the time because a lot of college students play music really loud at night. Just... This was old-fashioned music, from early 1900's, waltzing almost. But I'll save that significance until close to the end.\nAs we rounded the back my boyfriend sensed hands pressing from behind. Yesterday around 10:30pm he had also sensed the same feeling walking in front of Holmdene, much to my chagrin. So he knew this feeling, which was not cold or hot, but a physical feeling like someone was hanging onto him from behind. Jane suddenly got a name: Samantha. We used the pendulum method again to figure out if that was really her name. According to this method it was, and she was scared. This is why she was hanging onto my boyfriend's coat, and why she had been following him the day before. Then what followed her really freaked us out.\nJohn, surprisingly, was the first person to sense him. He said he smelled something burning, like incense. We stopped and sniffed. I smelled wood burning, like pine trees, and the other two smelled cigar smoke or pipe smoke. Now, analyze these smells, the smell of incense could symbolize a good spirit, the pine trees a neutral\/good spirit, but the last smell... What they smelled was tobacco, maybe, that means someone was with us who had possibly been a smoker. But Samantha was scared of it. She hid behind my boyfriend the entire time. We were standing in a circle, my boyfriend next to Jane with John across from her and me to her right. Then we decided to ask Samantha some questions about the spirit that was scaring her.\nWhat we got was that he was bad, and he was the stableman of Bukowski Chapel (which used to be a stable). This guy was HORRIBLE news! He tried to attack John, who was beginning to have pain in his shoulder blades, and he followed us all the way the edge of Holmdene. The cigar smoke turned into burning rubber. And it stank. We left as fast as we could, and Samantha was close behind.\nThis is only half of what went on that night. Jane later got possessed by Samantha and we were able to ask Sam some questions about her death. It was a dangerous thing that took us by surprise, but luckily Samantha was not a negative ghost, just a sad one, and Jane was able to get a hold of her body within a few minutes. The hunt ended around 1am, and we were all satisfied, some more so than others.\nBut that brings us to the music I heard. I didn't take note of it then, and I had put it out of my head for good until one of my other friends, a person with a high level of the sixth sense who did not go on the hunt, told me about some of her experiences in Holmdene. She says there was a spirit on the third floor of Holmdene that freaked her out, who was really eerie. My friend got the feeling this woman was crazy, but evil crazy. According to her, this woman always sang a song about burning children and drowning them, stuff that would put someone in the loony bin right away. Something about what my friend said sparked my interest and I inquired about the song, asking her to sing it. She sang a line and I froze in my tracks. It was the same old-fashioned song I had heard during our hunt at Holmdene.\nWith ghosts, demons, and angels around every corner, and people who do not normally have a sense for the paranormal suddenly finding they are being watched by something... That something is lurking in the shadows... That the shadows move... It is a very active location for spirits and what I think is the most haunted place in Michigan.\nStrange Woman In An Abandoned College?\nCollege Entity 2 - Do You Believe?\nThe following comments are submitted by users of this site and are not official positions by yourghoststories.com.

The author, somecathchick, has the following expectation about your feedback: I will read the comments and participate in the discussion.\nA year old... 3 years old... Whatever. \ud83d\ude33 Sorry I was looking at the last dated comment, hehe.\nI sadly never saw anything, any signs, any sounds anything that convinced me that any of those stories were true. I hate to say this, because it really is the perfect setting for a ghost story. I know other employees who do work in Holmdene, and they all swear they have seen something, so perhaps the ghosts just didn't appreciate a cook in their building.\nI just find it sad that the ghost is said to be the young son. Even though people have claimed to have seen him, I think its a sad exsistance for a child to have.\nI can tell those who doubt the overall story, it is not made up, it is quite famous here in Michigan, and like I said, many employees of Aquinas college agree there is a haunting there.\nI'm not sure about the possession part though.\nI think that is so cool, and I'm thinking of writing a book and I was wondering if I could use a little of this in is?\nLuca-I didn't write this. My friend sent this to me in an email. If it seems too movie-like, it's probably due to her writing style.\nIn case anyone else is wondering, this event actually happened.\nHow do I know? As reluctant as I am to admit it, I'm \"Jane\" in the story.\nUnfortunately, we didn't get many pictures or other evidence during our hunt, mainly because we were a bit preoccupied with communicating with the spirits we encountered. There was a lot of activity on account of it being close to Halloween, more than would normally be expected.\nGiven what we experienced that night, we were lucky\/blessed to be able to leave without any serious harm done to any of us. Sometime in the future I may write down my take on the whole night, but for now I'll leave this story as is.\nThis sounds like a crossover between Heroes and Ghostbusters. Maybe I should write this down and subject it to copyright.\nI'm sorry, Somecath, but this is way too movie-like. Maybe it's the way you wrote the story, the way the events unfolded or just the entire thing combined. I urge you to further explain what happened.\nHere is a question. How do you actuall get the ability to sense ghosts? I guess it just comes naturally.\nMy goodness it must be something to have friends with this much psychic energy. They should all be auditioning for Ghost Hunters or Ghost Adventures. I don't know what to make of this story. If fiction this person has a flair for it. If true, someone should be documenting and using digital recorders and cameras and video equipment to capture evidence. If one is so psychic as to draw spirits to them be prepared to get some evidence. If not, it's just a personal experience and can't be backed up.\nI'm going to save my comments on this one until I see what some of the others here think. Thank you for sharing your story!\n\u00a9 The ghost story A College Haunting is copyrighted to somecathchick.

{"text":"The shoot for the creative documentary Tales from the Prison Cell by \u00c1bel Visky, which kicked off two years ago, has just wrapped. This is the feature debut by the 31-year-old Romanian-born director, who studied at the Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest under the tutelage of Ildik\u00f3 Enyedi and J\u00e1nos Sz\u00e1sz, and who made a name for himself with various short films, such as Playfellows and Romanian Sunrise.\nTales from the Prison Cell, the screenplay for which was written by the director himself, revolves around the relationship between fathers in prison and their children at home. In addition to the focus of presenting three incarcerated fathers, we gain an insight into the forever-altered lives of their families and children. As we become familiar with their daily lives, we witness the distance and even the closeness that grows between the inmates and their families. As a way of keeping contact, the inmates write fairy tales for their kids, which are then made into films with the children playing the lead roles. The stories convey messages that the fathers have come to see as basic truths during the course of their own lives and believe are important to pass on. Within these stories, in the freedom created by fiction, father and child can be united once again.\nProduced by Eszter Gy\u00e1rf\u00e1s for Proton Cinema, with Vikt\u00f3ria Petr\u00e1nyi serving as line producer, Tales from the Prison Cell is being co-produced by London-based outfit Taskovski Films (which will also take care of the international sales), Croatia\u2019s Fade In and Hungary\u2019s Arisona MPS, with backing from the Incubator programme of the Hungarian National Film Fund, the Croatian Film Fund (HAVC) and Creative Europe.

{"text":"The European Commission has taken the strongest action yet in global efforts to protect bee colonies. In May, the commission enacted a two-year moratorium on some uses of some pesticides known as neonicotinoids, which remain in the tissues of plants as they grow and in the pollen harvested by bees. The moratorium is scheduled to take effect on Dec. 1. Pesticide manufacturers should not be allowed to derail it.\nAlarmed at declining bee populations over the past 15 years or so, particularly in Western Europe, the commission in 2012 allocated resources to 17 member states to look into why bees were in trouble. It moved to ban neonicotinoids after scientific studies reported by the European Food Safety Authority indicated a strong link between these pesticides and bee health. A new Italian study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States indicates that neonicotinoids at levels found commonly in fields weaken bees\u2019 immunity to viruses.\nTwo European manufacturers of these pesticides, Bayer CropScience of Germany and Syngenta of Switzerland, have brought legal action against the commission\u2019s decision in the Court of Justice of the European Union. The companies argue that the studies are flawed and that neonicotinoids, when properly used, do not put bees at risk. Scientists are divided. Some fear farmers may use even more lethal pesticides if neonicotinoids are banned.\nThe United Nations Environment Program has outlined multiple factors affecting bee health. In addition to herbicides and pesticides, threats include habitat degradation, viruses, parasites, pests, air pollution and electromagnetic fields. Apart from the pesticide moratorium, the European Union and a United Nations department in June sponsored the second European Week of Bees and Pollination, bringing together scientists from around the world to assess what should be done to protect bees. The European Union also announced it would invest \u20ac13.1 million to promote bee health, improve food security and protect biodiversity in Africa.\nIn the United States, a group of professional beekeepers and environmental groups filed a lawsuit in March against the Environmental Protection Agency demanding the suspension of two neonicotinoid pesticides. Oregon imposed a temporary ban in June on dinotefuran, a neonicotinoid pesticide, after 50,000 bumblebees died when the pesticide was sprayed on trees in a parking lot. And a bill introduced in Congress, the Saving America\u2019s Pollinators Act, would suspend certain uses of neonicotinoid pesticides until the E.P.A. can better determine their role in bee deaths.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.ontariobee.com\/inside-oba\/news-and-updates\/ny-times-editorial-bee-survival-in-europe"}

{"text":"Eating right and safeguarding your hearing have some similarities. It\u2019s hard to know where to begin even though it sounds like a good idea. This is especially true if you don\u2019t consider your daily environment to be very noisy and there aren\u2019t any noticeable dangers to your ears. But everyday life can put stress on your ears and your senses, so your auditory acuity can be maintained if you apply these tips.\nIf you want to continue to enjoy the sounds around you, you should do everything you can to slow down the impairment of your hearing.\nUsing hearing protection is the most sensible and simple way to safeguard your ears. This means taking basic actions to minimize the amount of loud and damaging noises you\u2019re subjected to.\nBut when to wear hearing protection is the question. We\u2019re used to associating harmful noise with painful noise. But much lower levels of sound can damage your ears than you might believe. After only a couple hours, for instance, the sounds of traffic are enough to damage your hearing. Knowing when sound becomes harmful, then, is a vital step in safeguarding your hearing.\n95-100 dB: This is about the sound level you\u2019d get from farm equipment or the normal volume of your earbuds. After around 15-20 minutes this level of noise becomes harmful.\n85 decibels (dB): After around two hours this level of sound is damaging.This is the volume of sound you\u2019d expect from a busy city street or your hairdryer.\nOver 100 dB: Your ears can be very rapidly injured by this. Damage is done in about thirty seconds with sounds over this limit. Jet engines and rock concerts, for example, can injure your ears in around thirty seconds.\nWe can take steps to minimize our exposure, now that we have a concept of what levels will be dangerous. The trick is that, once you\u2019re out and about in the real world, it can be challenging to measure what\u2019s loud and what isn\u2019t.\nHaving a live sound meter with you will help you measure everything you\u2019re hearing in decibels, so you\u2019ll have a far better idea of what dangerous levels actually sound like in your everyday life.\nA smartphone with earbuds is usually the way people listen to music nowadays. This sets up a dangerous situation for your hearing. Over years of use, earbuds set to a sufficiently high level can cause significant damage to your hearing.\nThat\u2019s why protecting your ears means keeping a focused eye on your volume control. You should not raise the volume to drown out noises somewhere else. in order to make sure that volume doesn\u2019t get too high, we recommend using volume configurations or app settings.\nEarbud use can become a negative feedback loop if your hearing begins to wane; you could find yourself constantly raising the volume of your earbuds in order to compensate for your faltering hearing, doing more harm to your ears in the process.\nYou might think that having a hearing exam is something you do only when your hearing begins to diminish. The problem is that it\u2019s not always easy to identify a problem in your ears without a standard to compare results to.\nScheduling a hearing screening or exam is a great way to obtain data that can be used for both treatment and diagnostic purposes, making certain that all of your future hearing (and hearing protection) choices have some added context and information.\nIt would be perfect if you could constantly safeguard your hearing without any difficulty. But challenges are will always be there. So safeguard your hearing when you can, as often as possible. You should also have your hearing tested routinely. Put these suggestions into practice to improve your chances.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.mainlineaudiology.com\/your-hearing-can-be-protected-if-you-follow-these-tips\/"}
{"text":"Let\u2019s be honest, we all wish we could fly around in one of Iron Man\u2019s suits. Zipping around the sky, blasting enemies with hand cannons and missiles. Anthem is that dream come true. When the demo works, it very works well. Flying around a massive, beautiful world was a rush, and blowing things up felt just as great as I imagined it would. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work most of the time. Loading screens were unbelievably long, and would usually never finish, forcing you to restart the game entirely. Constant crashes, enemies just disappearing, and some of the worst lag I\u2019ve ever experienced.\nEA apologized for the server issues, stating that they planned on turning more on soon. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s time to pull out the ol\u2019 soapbox and go on a rant because this excuse needs to stop. It\u2019s 2019 people, I could understand this explanation when online games were first getting started, but how is this still catching developers off guard? They had a very good expectation of how many players had pre-ordered their game, and how many free codes would\u2019ve been shared because of it. This excuse just boils down to poor planning on their part, and it doesn\u2019t start to shine a good light on their skills, or their product because of it. If they can\u2019t even handle a demo, how can we expect they will do with the full launch?\nSoapbox put away, let\u2019s talk about how the game held up when it was working. Before players fly off, they are introduced to the player hub. You walk around in first person view, interacting with various objects and people, 90% of which have nothing to say or offer in the demo. It looks to be a fully fleshed out town by the time full launch comes around, and based off the few interactions we did get, I imagine it to be a very entertaining world. It was very reminiscent of Horizon: Zero Dawn. Perhaps not as primitive, but the direction it\u2019s going felt very similar. With mission details provided, It was then time to customize your death machine.\nEveryone starts in the Ranger type Javelin, a good machine with balanced attributes. The demo only allowed for a minor amount of visual customization options. You could unlock a few new parts to change up the way your Javelin looked, as well as give it a quick paint job. As you take on missions, you will unlock new weapons, and once you level up, you can unlock a new type of Javelin of your choice. There is the Colossus Javelin, a massive beast of a machine resembling the Hulkbuster. It\u2019s slow but powerful! The tank class, with skills like taunting enemies, or defending with a massive shield. Next, we have the Storm Javelin, Anthem\u2019s version of a mage. This machine trades defense for raw, elemental killing power. Lastly is the quick, support type, the Interceptor. Great at getting in, dropping some quick damage, and getting the heck out of there.\nWhen all is said and done, and your Javelin suit finally touches down, the feeling is fluid, and combat is exhilarating. It took some time to get used to the controls, as there is no in-game tutorial for the demo. HUD elements will tell you which button to press to unleash one of your many explosive armaments, but flying controls are completely up to trial and error. The more you fly, the better you get at it, and eventually, you will learn little tricks like flying close to water to keep your systems cooled, and you up in the air longer. There are a few missions included in the demo, a free roam expedition mode, and one raid-like dungeon with an exciting boss fight.\nWith just the small taste given, I am hungry for more, but the poor manner in which EA put this all together has me worried. We\u2019ll just have to hope this was an eye-opening experience for them, but if they haven\u2019t learned anything in over a decade, should we bother holding our breath?","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/pastramination.com\/first-look-anthem-vip-demo\/"}

He was assigned to Combat Logistics Regiment 2, 2nd Marine Logistics Group, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Lejeune, N.C. LCpl. Collins\u2019 body arrived in Dover yesterday, October 7. Due to the shutdown, it is unclear if his parents will be able to meet their son\u2019s coffin in Dover. The funeral costs will be out of their own pockets. While the Marine Corps is providing the support they can, the government has essentially abandoned the Collins family, deeming their son worthy to fight for his country, to die for his country, but not worthy of having monetary assistance (as promised by contract) provided for his family until the government ends their childish standoff.

{"text":"Hiya guys! I've teamed up with some fantastic bloggers to bring you a segment showcasing each of our top five indie polishes. I had such a hard time trying to decide which ones to pick. Think about the torture of going through five helmers to pick out five!?! It was definitely not fun... okay maybe it was a little fun. It should go without saying that I kept changing my mind back and forth. A lot. Heck I was even dreaming about my choices. Polish addict problems, haha. After much contemplating, I had a break through! At the end of every month, I'll be sharing my top five indie polishes swatched within that month span. Fun times will be had. Now without further ado, here's my monthly top five picks for June!\nSee some familiar ones? Because this is the first time doing this I ended up dipping into May swatches as well. Look at me breaking the rules already sheesh.\nPurple Nurpled is a dark purple jelly filled with bright blue micro and square glitters. I've had this polish for over a year and it is still the first purple I end up thinking about when I want to do my nails. Earlier this month this was re-released with the relaunch of Supernatural Lacquer, but it's currently once again sold out. The good news is that it will be restocked in a few weeks.\nStrawberry Blast is a bright red jelly polish filled with small black micro glitters. That. Squishy. Finish. I'm so in love with this polish that it's probably one of my favorites of all time. Everything about it is perfection and it nails the namesake. This one is still available for purchase for only $8.00 at Savvy Naturalista's shop.\nVitamin Sea can be described as an aqua jelly polish with pink, silver, and micro holographic glitter. The KB Shimmer summer release this year completely blew my mind away... and my wallet... and my husbands. He's still not happy about it, haha. But there is nothing more that I love than a gorgeous teal crelly and this one was made for my little polish addicted heart. This one is still available for purchase for only $8.75 at KB Shimmer's shop.\nSantorini is described as a medium cobalt blue creme. I know a lot of people think of cremes as 'boring', but they are one of my most used finishes! Uh... hello watermarbles, gradients, stamping... the possibilities are endless. Unfortunately this blue wonder is no longer available for purchase as it was an LE in the collaboration with Nordstrom Pop-In Event.\nPlayful Purple is a thermal that shifts from a bright fuchsia when warm to a dark purple when cold. My love for thermals simply cannot be tamed and this summer CDB Lacquer introduced an entire collection of neon thermals. Trust me if I could put the entire collection on this list I would. Each of the gorgeous bright colors were available in three finishes and could watermarble and stamp. Yeah, it's no wonder these sold out so quickly.\nSo what did you think of my May\/June picks? It was so hard to narrow down! I'm glad I decided to participate in this segment though. Sometimes even though I may absolutely love a polish it can easily get drowned out in my massive collection. This should also make my end of the year round-up a little easier... right?! Oh gawd, let's not that think about that now haha. I can do without the polish induced nightmares for a bit.\nTell me guys, did you see any new or old favorites here?\nLovely choices! I hope I can get some Supernatural Lacquers during the next restock!!\nI'm anxiously waiting for the next restock too there are a few more I'd love to nab! She sold out so quickly last time.\nGreat choices!! I love the CDB lacquer!\nThanks! CDB Lacquer really knocked it out of the park this year with these neon thermals.\nUgh Roselynn, theyre all so freaking pretty on you! Great choices!\nNice choices! I opened this up and fell in love with Purple Nurpled!\nThat's definitely one of my all time favorites. I cannot believe I have had it over a year and it's still flawless.\nDefinitely agree! Cirque Colors does cremes so amazingly.\nI want to buy every single one of yours! The jelliesssss!\nThese are all beautiful! I adore that Strawberry polish. So pretty!\nGreat picks! I love Strawberry Blast from Savvy Naturalista and may need to get my hands on it!\nI love posts like these!! I STILL need to try Cirque out!!\nPurple Nurpled and Vitamin Sea would both make my list, too--love them. :) Can't wait til my post goes up tomorrow!\nOoooh that Cirque looks amazing!!\nVitamin Sea andPurple Nurpled just went on my lemmings list!\nBeautiful choices! I love Santorini!!!\nPlayful purple is so gorgeous. I wish thermals lasted longer or I would have more.\nAwesome choices! I think the KBShimmer and the Cirque are my favs of your picks.","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/www.manicuredandmarvelous.com\/2015\/06\/top-5-indies-swatched-june-2015.html"}

{"text":"A disk drive contains an integrally-formed one-piece hub, clamp and rotor housing, which is preferably injection-molded plastic. In the preferred embodiment, the hub includes a hollow cylindrical portion (201) for surrounding a set of bearings mounted on a central shaft, and a flange portion (202) extending from the middle of the cylinder and supporting a single disk (101). Compliant clamping fingers (203) on the upper surface of the flange engage the disk through its central hole. The fingers are inclined slightly outward, and include a pawl at the end of each finger. During assembly, the disk is forced over the pawls of the fingers until they engage the disk. The fingers, being slightly elastic, will deform to permit the disk to slide over the pawls, and then return to lock the disk in place. The fingers automatically center the disk about the hub axis, without the need for centering tools. The ub also serves as a housing for the rotor of a spindle motor which rotates the disk. A back iron ring and permanent magnets are attached to the underside of the flange at its outer edge to form the rotor. An electromagnetic stator assembly surrounds the disk axis in the annular space defined by the flange, the permanent magnets and back iron at the outer edge, and the cylindrical portion of the hub at the inner edge.\nThe present invention relates to disk drive data storage devices, and in particular to disk and hub assemblies used in disk drive storage devices.\nThe extensive data storage needs of modern computer systems require large capacity mass data storage devices. A common storage device is the rotating magnetic disk drive.\nA disk drive typically contains one or more smooth, flat disks which are rigidly attached to a common spindle. The disks are stacked on the spindle parallel to each other and spaced apart so that they do not touch. The disks and spindle are rotated in unison at a constant speed by a spindle motor.\nEach disk is formed of a solid disk-shaped base or substrate, having a hole in the middle for the spindle. The substrate is commonly aluminum, although glass, ceramic, plastic or other materials are possible. The substrate is coated with a thin layer of magnetizable material, and may additionally be coated with a protective layer.\nData is recorded on the surfaces of the disks in the magnetizable layer. To do this, minute magnetized patterns representing the data are formed in the magnetizable layer. The data patterns are usually arranged in circular concentric tracks. Each track is further divided into a number of sectors. Each sector thus forms an arc, all the sectors of a track completing a circle.\nA moveable actuator positions a transducer head adjacent the data on the surface to read or write data. The actuator may be likened to the tone arm of a phonograph player, and the head to the playing needle.\nThere is one transducer head for each disk surface containing data. The transducer head is an aerodynamically shaped block of material (usually ceramic) on which is mounted a magnetic read\/write transducer. The block, or slider, flies above the surface of the disk at an extremely small distance as the disk rotates. The close proximity to the disk surface is critical in enabling the transducer to read from or write to the data patterns in the magnetizable layer. Several different transducer designs are used, and in some cases the read transducer is separate from the write transducer.\nThe actuator usually pivots about an axis to position the head. It typically includes a solid block near the axis having comb-like arms extending toward the disk, a set of thin suspensions attached to the arms, and an electro-magnetic motor on the opposite side of the axis. The transducer heads are attached to the suspensions, one head for each suspension. The actuator motor rotates the actuator to position the head over a desired data track. Once the head is positioned over the track, the constant rotation of the disk will eventually bring the desired sector adjacent the head, and the data can then be read or written.\nAs computer systems have become more powerful, faster, and more reliable, there has been a corresponding increase in demand for improved storage devices. These desired improvements take several forms. It is desirable to reduce cost, to increase data capacity, to increase the speed at which the drives operate, to reduce the electrical power consumed by the drives, and to increase the resilience of the drives in the presence of mechanical shock and other disturbances.\nIn particular, there is a demand to reduce the physical size of disk drives. To some degree, reduction in size may serve to further some of the above goals. But at the same time, reduced size of disk drives is desirable in and of itself. Reduced size makes it practical to include magnetic disk drives in a range of portable applications, such as laptop computers, mobile pagers, and \"smart cards\".\nAn example of size reduction is the application of the PCMCIA Type II standard to disk drives. This standard was originally intended for semiconductor plug-in devices. With improvements to miniaturization technology, it will be possible to construct disk drives conforming to the PCMCIA Type II standard.\nIn order to shrink the size of disk drives, every component must be reduced in size as much as possible. Additionally, new designs of existing components must be developed to permit reduced size and make assembly of miniaturized components practical.\nOne limit on the extent to which a disk drive can be reduced in size is the disk\/hub assembly. A conventional disk\/hub assembly comprises a cylindrical hub having a flange at the bottom for supporting a disk stack. A motor for rotating the disks is located within the hub. The stack of disks rests on the upper surface of the flange, the hub fitting within corresponding holes of the disks. The individual disks are separated by spacer rings surrounding and adjacent to the hub. A clamping apparatus is attached to the top of the hub and applies a downward force to the disk stack, forcing the bottom disk against the flange and holding the stack in place. Where a disk drive has only a single disk, essentially the same design is used, but the clamping apparatus clamps only the one disk instead of the disk stack. The clamping apparatus is typically a flat steel ring having a formed circular ridge near its outer edge. The flat portion of the ring is attached to the upper surface of the hub with screws, while the ridge portion applies pressure to the disk stack or single disk. Several alternative clamp designs exist, but all involve multiple parts.\nThe conventional disk drive disk\/hub design is not well suited to very small form factor disks, such as the PCMCIA Type II form factor. The hub must be sufficiently large to accommodate the screws. Even where very small screws are used, this requirement adds to the size and weight of the hub. The extremely small parts make assembly difficult. There is difficultly tolerating high mechanical shock of portable applications. The relatively thin disks tend to warp when clamped with sufficient clamping force; even a small warpage can be serious when track widths are being reduced. Finally, although the drive is much smaller, simple scaling down of the size of conventional parts will not result in any significant cost reduction; in fact, it may increase costs. It is desirable to develop an alternative hub\/disk assembly which reduces costs and is more suitable to the design requirements of small form factor disk drives.\nIn an European patent application EP A-0 613 134, a magnetic disk unit which is integrally formed with a sleeve portion of a ball bearing unit, or a spindle of a spindle motor for driving the disk which is mounted on a rotor. But this document aims particularly at avoiding to align the rotor with respect to the rotary axis of the ball bearing unit.\nIt is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an enhanced rotating disk data storage device.\nAnother object of this invention is to reduce the cost of a rotating disk data storage device.\nAnother object of this invention is to provide a small form factor rotating disk data storage device having an enhanced hub\/disk assembly.\nAnother object of this invention is to provide a small form factor disk drive having a reduced cost hub\/disk assembly.\nAnother object of this invention is to provide a rotating disk data storage device comprising a hub\/disk assembly having fewer parts.\nAnother object of this invention is to provide a rotating disk data storage device comprising a hub\/disk assembly which is easier to fabricate and assemble.\nAnother object of this invention is to provide a rotating disk data storage device comprising a hub\/disk assembly having greater resistance to mechanical shock.\nAnother object of this invention is to provide a rotating disk data storage device comprising a hub\/disk assembly having reduced distortion of the disk.\nA rotating disk data storage device according to the invention as defined in claim 1.\nFig. 8 is a sectional view of an alternate design for a clamping finger and disk.\nFig. 1 shows a magnetic disk drive storage unit 100 in accordance with the preferred embodiment. Disk unit 100 comprises rotatable disk 101, which is rigidly attached to hub 103, which is mounted on disk drive base or housing 104. Hub 103 and disk 101 are driven by a drive motor at a constant rotational velocity. The drive motor is contained within hub 103. Actuator assembly 105 is situated to one side of disk 101. Actuator 105 rotates through an arc about shaft 106 parallel to the axis of disk 101, driven by electro-magnetic motor 107, to position the transducer heads. A cover (not shown) mates with base 104 to enclose and protect the disk and actuator assemblies. Electronic modules for controlling the operation of the drive and communicating with another device, such as a host computer, are mounted on a circuit card 112 within the head\/disk enclosure formed by base 104 and the cover. In this embodiment, circuit card 112 is mounted within the enclosure and shaped to take up unused space around the disk in order to conserve space, as would be used for a PCMCIA Type II form factor. However, the card 112 could also be mounted outside the head\/disk enclosure, or the base itself could be made as a circuit card for mounting electronic modules directly to it. A plurality of head\/suspension assemblies 108 are rigidly attached to the prongs of actuator 105. An aerodynamic read\/write transducer head 109 is located at the end of each head\/suspension assembly 108 adjacent the disk surface.\nHub 103 is a one-piece, integrally-formed part which also contains clamping means for locking disk 101 in place, and which functions as a rotor housing for the drive motor. By \"integrally-formed\", it should be understood that hub 103 is a uniform material formed as a single solid mass by molding, casting, extruding, or other means, and may be machined, etched, or otherwise shaped as necessary to the required dimensions; hub 103 is not built up from multiple discrete components attached together. In the preferred embodiment, hub 103 is an injection molded polymeric part. Specifically, it is preferred that the polymer be a polyetherimide (PEI), in particular Ultem 7201, which is commercially available from General Electric Corporation. Ultem 7201 is preferred because its coefficient of thermal expansion is close to that of aluminum, the preferred material for disk 101. However, other suitable polymers may be used. Alternatively, it may be possible to use non-polymeric materials, such as aluminum or ceramic.\nFig. 2 is an isometric view of integral hub, clamp and rotor housing 103 according to the preferred embodiment. Hub 103 preferably includes a hollow cylindrical base portion 201, a relatively flat cylindrical flange portion 202 extending from base portion 201, and a plurality of circumferentially spaced fingers 203 for engaging disk 101 and serving as a clamping means.\nFig. 3 is a sectional view, in the plane of the disk axis, of integral hub, clamp and rotor housing 103 according to the preferred embodiment. As can be seen more clearly in the sectional view of Fig. 3, hollow cylindrical base portion 201 defines a central cylindrical hole 301 for the disk shaft and bearings. Flange portion 202 extends from approximately the middle of base portion 201. A circumferential lip 302 extends downward from the lower surface of flange portion 202, near its outer edge. Lip 302 provides a mating surface and support for a rotor back iron and permanent magnets.\nFig. 4 is a top view of integral hub, clamp and rotor housing 103 according to the preferred embodiment. In the preferred embodiment, hub 103 contains eight equally spaced fingers 203 positioned as shown, it being understood that the number and size of the fingers may vary, and that other integral clamping means may be used within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.\nFig. 5 shows in greater detail hub 103 and related hardware, including components of the spindle motor, when assembled, in accordance with the preferred embodiment. Fig. 5 is a half sectional view, taken in the plane of the axis of rotation of the disks. While hub 103 and related components on only one side of the axis are depicted in Fig. 5, it should be understood that these are symmetrical about the axis.\nDisk shaft 502 is rigidly attached to base 104 of the disk drive. Shaft 502 is preferably steel. Disk axis 501 runs through the center of shaft 502. Hub cylindrical portion 201 is mounted on bearing assembly 504 for rotation about axis 501. Bearing assembly preferably comprises two sets of preloaded ball bearings in sealed bearing races, at opposite ends of shaft 502. However, bearing assembly could alternatively be a fluid (hydrodynamic) or other type of bearing. In another alternative, portions of bearing assembly 504 may be integrally formed with hub 103, as for example by forming a fluid bearing surface on the inner surface of hub cylindrical portion 201.\nFlange portion 202 of hub 103 extends outward from cylindrical base portion 201 at approximately the middle of its length. Disk 101 rests on the upper surface of flange portion 202, the flange supporting disk 101 from below. Multiple identical circumferentially spaced fingers 203 protrude from the upper surface of flange 202 to engage disk 101 and lock it in place, thus serving as a clamping means and obviating the need for a separately attached clamp.\nBack iron 505 and set of permanent rotor magnets 506 for a brushless DC spindle motor are attached to the underside of flange portion 202 at the outer edge. Back iron 505 is a ring of magnetically permeable material, preferably an Fe-Pb alloy. Back iron 505 may also be a wound series of laminations forming a ring. Magnets 506 are preferably a solid ring of suitable magnetizable material, in which successive arcuate segments are magnetized to alternating magnetic polarity. Magnets 506 thus form a set of permanent arcuate magnets, circumferentially arranged about the disk axis to completely encircle the axis, having alternating polarity.\nCircumferential lip 302 provides support for back iron 505 and magnets 506. Back iron 505 is preferably bonded to hub 103 at lip 302 and lower surface of flange 202 using a suitable adhesive. Alternatively, it may be attached to hub 103 during the injection molding process by inserting back iron 505 in the mold cavity and molding hub 103 over back iron 505. Permanent magnets 506 are preferably bonded directly to back iron 505 using a suitable adhesive.\nSpindle motor electromagnetic stator 508 is attached to base 104 and positioned underneath flange 202, within the annular space defined by cylindrical base portion 201 at the inner radius and back iron 505 and magnets 506 at the outer radius. Stator 508 comprises a set of circumferentially spaced electromagnets (poles) surrounding the disk axis, each pole comprising a wire coil wrapped around a magnetically permeable core. Stator 508 is connected to motor drive electronics (not shown) on circuit card 112. In operation, the motor drive electronics sequentially pulse different poles of stator 508 to generate a rotating electromagnetic field, as is known in the art. In the preferred embodiment, stator 508 is a 3-phase stator having three poles in each phase (total of nine poles), and rotor magnet set 506 comprises twelve magnetic pole segments. However, the number of stator and rotor poles may vary.\nFig. 6 is a sectional view in the plane of the disk axis of a clamping finger 203, showing the finger in greater detail. Finger 203 is molded with a slight outward inclination to apply a small radial force to the inner hole of disk 101. Preferably, the angle of inclination is approximately 3 degrees, i.e. the angle \ue70d in Fig. 6 is approximately 87 degrees, it being understood that the optimum angle will vary with the thickness of the finger and type of material selected. Near the end of finger 203 is a pawl 601 for engaging disk 101. Pawl 601 contains chamfered top edge 603 to enable assembly of the disk.\nFig. 7 is a sectional view of clamping finger 203, showing how it clamps disk 101 in place. Disk 101 and finger 203 are shown in cross-section in the plane of the disk axis.\nDisk 101 preferably contains chamfered inner edges 711,712, which are chamfered at approximately a 45 degree angle. The chamfers make assembly of disk 101 to hub 103 easier, provide a surface for application of force from pawl 601, and help to center the disk.\nDisk 101 is preferably assembled to hub 103 by positioning disk 101 over the fingers and pushing directly downward. When pushing downward, chamfered edge 712 on the bottom surface of disk 101 slides against chamfered edge 603 on the top surface of pawl 601. Because finger 203 is made from an elastic material, finger 203 retracts inward (toward the disk axis) as disk 101 is pushed down upon it, enabling the narrowest part of the disk center hole to clear the pawl. After the narrowest part of the disk center hole clears the pawl, the finger returns to near its original position due to the natural elasticity of the material. When the bottom surface of disk 101 rests upon flange 202, pawl 601 will be positioned as shown in Fig. 7, applying a force to chamfered edge 711.\nPawl 601 applies both a downward axial force and a radial force to chamfered edge 711. The downward axial force pushes disk 101 against the upper surface of flange portion 202, securely clamping disk 101 in place.\nBecause a plurality of circumferentially spaced fingers, all at the same radius from the disk axis, apply the same radial force to the chamfered inner edge 711 of the disk center hole, the disk is automatically centered about the axis as it is forced over the fingers and into its assembled position on the flange. Thus, there is no need for centering tools.\nPreferably, finger 203 makes contact with the non-chamfered portion of the inner edge of the hole in disk 101, applying a slight radial force. Finger 203 acts as a non-linear beam spring. At rest with the disk in place, the radial force is small to avoid warping the disk. However, the radial force imparted by the finger increases at more than a linear rate if the finger is bent back (in the direction toward the disk axis). As a result, a much stronger force will oppose any movement of the disk from its proper position. The hub therefore achieves a high resistance to mechanical shock with a very low cost, simple design.\nDuring drop testing, it was observed that the compliant fingers absorb a substantial part of the energy being transmitted by disk 101 to hub 103, thus preventing damage to the bearing systems. This feature is very desirable for portable media technology.\nWarpage of disks is a well known problem in the disk drive art. A conventional clamp must exert considerable axial force on the clamped disk to ensure that the disk does not move. This force tends to warp the disk. It has been observed that the compliant clamping mechanism of the present invention achieves a secure clamping of the disk with virtually no warpage. Unlike conventional clamp designs, which typically use a metal clamp, the hub of the present invention is made from a compliant material which is preferably much softer than the disk itself. The surface of the compliant material deforms at the point of contact (i.e., the upper surface of flange portion 202 and fingers 203) with the disk, providing a relatively higher static coefficient of friction than is usually present with the metal-to-metal contact of a conventional disk clamp. Due to the higher coefficient of friction, the disk can be securely clamped using a smaller axial force. Additionally, because the disk material is substantially harder than the hub material, the hub surface rather than the disk surface deforms at the points of contact. The disk accordingly experiences very little local strain near the inner diameter, resulting in very low warpage as compared to a conventional disk.\nThe dimensions of finger 203 must be selected for the chosen hub material to provide suitable compliance of the finger, and to simultaneously provide sufficient clamping force when the disk is in place. In the preferred embodiment finger 203 is approximately 0.25 mm wide in the radial dimension, and 1 mm wide in the circumferential direction. The overall height of the finger is approximately 1 mm. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that optimal finger dimensions will vary depending on the qualities of the material. A stiffer hub material may require a thinner finger, and vice-versa. It will further be appreciated that the dimensions will vary depending upon the size and material of the disk itself. The dimensions given above for the preferred embodiment are intended for use with a 1.8\" (43.22 mm) disk formed of an aluminum substrate, and having a thickness of approximately .635mm, such as would be used for a PCMCIA Type II form factor.\nFig. 8 is a sectional view of an alternate design for a clamping finger 801 and disk. The alternate clamping finger 801 of Fig. 8 is identical to clamping finger 203 described above and shown in Figs. 1-7, except for the addition of a tab 802 projecting from the side of the finger facing the disk axis. Tab 802 provides a surface for engagement with a disk removal tool (not shown). To remove disk 101, the tool applies a downward force to tab 802, tending to bend finger 801 backward. At the same time, disk 101 is lifted from the flange portion 202 of hub 103. Removal of a disk is sometimes necessary during rework of a disk drive as part of the manufacturing and testing process.\nIn the preferred embodiment, the clamping means is a plurality of fingers extending from the upper surface of the flange and engaging the disk. However, any clamping means which is integrally formed with the hub may be used within the scope of the present invention defined by the claims. For example, the fingers might extend from some other portion of the hub, such as hollow cylindrical base portion 201. Fingers extending from some other portion, such as the cylindrical portion, might press down on the disk from above. Alternatively, the clamping means could be a deformable ring extending from the upper surface of the flange or from the hollow cylindrical portion, or a deformable ring broken at circumferentially spaced intervals for stress relief.\nIn the description above, certain features have been referred to as \"above\" or \"below\" the flange, and surfaces described as \"upper\" or \"lower\". These terms are used only for ease of reference and are consistent with the drawings and the normal orientation used in the art. However, the use of these terms is not meant to imply that the present invention requires the flange to be located below the disk and above the motor. The motor and disk drive of the present invention could just as easily be constructed with the flange located above the disk, or with the axis of rotation oriented horizontally.\ncharacterized in that said hub member also comprises a clamp structure (203) for locking said disk in place.\na flange portion (202) extending outward from said hollow cylindrical portion, said flange portion being said support structure for supporting said disk.\nThe rotating disk data storage device of claim 1 or 2, wherein said clamp structure of said hub member comprises a plurality of circumferentially spaced fingers (203) extending from said flange portion and engaging said disk.\nThe rotating disk data storage device of claim 2, wherein said hollow cylindrical portion (201) of said hub member surrounds a set of bearings (504) for mounting said hub member to said disk shaft.\nThe rotating disk data storage device of claim 2, wherein said set of rotor magnets (506) is attached to said flange portion near the outer edge thereof, and said stator (508) is positioned surrounding said disk shaft and between said disk shaft and said rotor magnets.\nThe rotating disk data storage device of anyone of claims 1 to 5, wherein said hub member is an injection molded polymeric part.\nThe rotating disk data storage device of anyone of claims 1 to 6, wherein said hub member is so shaped that said disk is self-centering upon said hub member.\nThe rotating disk data storage device of anyone of claims 1 to 5, wherein said hub member is formed from a resilient material, said resilient material being substantially more resilient than said disk.\neach said finger includes a pawl (601) at one end thereof, said fingers extending through said circular aperture of said disk, said pawls engaging said disk and imparting an axial force to said disk forcing said first surface of said disk against said support surface.\nThe rotating disk data storage device of claim 9, wherein said aperture of said disk forms an inner surface thereof surrounding said axis of rotation, and wherein said fingers contact said inner surface, each finger thereby imparting a radial force to said disk.\nThe rotating disk data storage device of claim 10, wherein a pawls engage said disk along a chamfered edge (711,712) surrounding said circular aperture.\nThe rotating disk data storage device of claim 9, wherein each said finger contains a projecting tab (802) for engagement with a disk removal tool, said projecting tab projecting from a side of said finger facing said disk axis.\nNL8700819A (en) * 1987-04-08 1988-11-01 Philips Nv An apparatus for recording information on or reading information from an information disc.\nFR2666842B1 (en) * 1990-09-17 1992-11-20 Somfy Winding device has tubular motor for blinds, roller shutters or the like.\nOwner name: BRAVI ALFREDO DR.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/patents.google.com\/patent\/EP0786134B1\/en"}

If you prefer your wire to remain round, use a nylon, hard plastic or rawhide mallet\/hammer. It will harden the wire without flattening it.\nUniform loops: for a tip on how to make your loops uniform throughout a project, click here.\nWe\u2019ll work right from the coil or spool of wire. (Don\u2019t cut any wire off.) Make a flush cut on the end.\nWe\u2019ll start by making a loop.\nHold the end of the wire in round nose pliers. Line up the wire with the mark. The wire should be at the top of the pliers, but not poking through.\nHold the loop in chain nose pliers with the wire off to the side. Push the wire up starting a spiral.\nContinue readjusting the loop in chain nose pliers with the wire to the side and pushing up creating a spiral.\nContinue until the spiral is the size you would like.\nLeave about 1\/2\u2033 tail and cut the wire making a flush cut.\nNow we\u2019ll make a loop. Follow the directions above in Step #2 to make a loop.\nIf the loop does not touch the spiral, return the spiral to chain nose pliers and push the wire so it\u2019s close.\nPlace the spiral on a steel block and hammer it. If you\u2019re using a chasing hammer to flatten the wire, the more you hammer the flatter and wider the spiral will become.\nFollow the steps above to make a second spiral.

Exactly what you want when you pull up in the new car and you want to show it off to your mates. Obviously as a performance parts retailer we are interested in all of this\u2026The G force meter really does it for me.\nHowever the 5 different modes make it suitable for every situation, want to take your good old Nan out? No issue, eco mode, softer suspension reduced power and torque and the exhaust valve closes up making the exhaust noise much quieter that you can still have a catch up with her whilst you listen to radio 2. The steering is made lighter, making those tight corners around town effortless.\nIf eco is not for you then you still have normal and sport mode, both affecting the power and chassis outputs in different ways, but lets get back to the performance\u2026N mode this is the mode you want, The mode that makes this car go crazy! The suspension is firmed up to the stiffest setting make a massive difference in the handling, the exhaust is opened up and the steering is set to normal giving you a much better feel of the road\/track around you. I find myself on every journey resorting back to this mode, the exhaust as standard has a nice sound, louder than you expect and pops at high revs, which can be easily seen not just heard with the shift lights flashing in front of you. Ending with N custom, this setting allows you to have it exqactly how you want, light steering with sport suspension no issue, just fiddle through the settings and have it however you want.\nThe bit some are struggling with is the Hyundai badge\u2026I can see why, 10-15 years not even that they wernt in the game. The cars they made back then had no styling and performance, however, whilst Honda, VW and other of the top manufactures have been battling it out, Hyundai have played the sneaky game and have released a weapon. It feels great, the set up of this car has been well built by Hyundai, with experience and knowledgeable support from the guy behind the M badge of BMW, The i30 interior is a nice place to be, we know the performance is spot on and it has a warranty of 5 years! Not many manufactures can say that. The greatest thing about the warranty is the fact that you will remain within the warranty on the track. Now that is confidence in your product right?\nOf course we were never going to leave this car standard that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. Within hours of receiving the Hyundai i30N we had it on the ramps and the exhaust off, we replaced it with none other then the Remus cat back system, we went for carbon tips which has always been our favourite but with chrome and black polished both available to us it was a difficult decision but we think we made the right choice, what do you think?\nNext we moved onto the suspension, Eibach have been talking about this car for a little while and already had the springs ready to go. Eibachs Pro-Kit springs offered a 15mm drop which is perfect and a similar ride around town and everyday driving, however we got invited by Eibach to go round track with them at Bruntingthorpe to physically show us the difference between standard and a Hyundai i30N with springs on. It was quite comparable at high speed corners youwere much more stableas the back end doesn\u2019t want to step out.\nThe Pipercross filter was spot on.\nWithin a day of having the Hyundai i30N Pipercross had come to visit us, measured up and taken the infomation they needed to start producing a replacement cone filter.\nWe was so suprised when they coame back with the product to find it fit better then the original? How is that even possible? The original had alot of movement and because of the hard plastic it was unable to truly sit well. The Pipercross fitted much better, the throttle response improved and we got a little bit more of an agressive intake noise, which we loved.\nSince then we have enjoyed the car, our quickest 0-60 time is 5.7 seconds using the in built lap timer and all the staff have very much enjoyed finding out the features.\nThe Remus powerizer is our next point of call. The simple plug and play use is ideal for anyone looking for power but if they ever want to remove it, they can just unplug it. The powerizer brings the figures on the car up an impressive amount.\nThis takes it past Megane, Cupra, S3, Golf R, even the Fk2 Civic Type R. we must admit, it is still FWD but this is going to make a difference. Well I beleive we can truly say goodbye Gti which now will be sitting 70 horsepower behind. The Gti has got to have one of the biggest followings in the car scene at the moment right? So this must be turning heads or at least shake some people up when they see a Hyundai i30N come up behind them. It is s no longer an 80 year old doing the Asda run, it now means\u2026get out the way!\nRemus Powerizer for the Hyundai i30 N performance click to be taken to our Ebay shop where this product is offered.\nWe will be following up with this power with spacers from Eibach to give us a better stance. 10mm all round should look perfect and then eventually wheels. We are struggling to decide what design to go for\u2026 let us know your thoughts on the car and the modifications we have completed so far We are extremely excited about this car and would love to hear your thoughts\u2026..is it a YAY or NAY?","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.potn.co.uk\/potn-car-hyundai-i30n-performance\/"}

{"text":"There are many ways of sacrifice and for different reasons.\nWhen we join the fire service, we do not know all the sacrifice that we will be making. We sacrifice our time going to classes, time away from our loved ones, when we are on duty or get called in for extra duty of filling in for someone that banged out sick. We sacrifice money to help those in need, our talents helping rebuild communities that have been affected by fire or disasters that we have responded to.\nA brother from Buffalo reminded me of all the sacrifices that a single parent makes. A single mother that raises her children on her own and also working a full time job. How many of us make the sacrifies for our children? How about our families sacrifiing us, so that we can serve others? Or sacrificing what we want for our children? I know that many times in families, some of the parents may go without some meals, so that there children can eat three meals a day. I have seen senior citizens eating cat food, so that they had money to pay for their medication.\nWe know that also part of the job may be put in the time for the citizens or a brother but why do we do it? What is the underlying reason that we are ready to sacrifice?\nWe may not say it or even know consciously but I believe that it is that we care for our fellow man and that starts with our family and members of our company. When one of our own members need help, especially for a mayday, we are willing to make great sacrifices. We carry out what we are taught, \"Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends.\" or another sign of sacrifice is: \"This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.\"\nWe make sacrifices by rolling out for calls, when the thermometer does not even come close to see 0 degrees, when it is just so hot that we are sweating even before putting on our gear. We make sacrifices by giving up our sleep to respond to calls. We sacrifice our bodies when we refuse to take care of ourselves and still handle calls when sick or injured. We always are willing to go, no matter what.\nLet us remember all the sacrifies that were made by our brothers. Those who have gone into a burning building, when a brother is trapped or those whose may stay in a building past the time that is safe. We look at the gain versus the risk, but many times we risk our lives, to save another's life.\nThose who have served in the military are willing to make sacrifices for freeedom, and for that we should always say 'Thank You!\" This month is the time that we also remember other sacrifices, especially the sacrifice that was made for us 2015 years ago, when Jesus died on the cross for our sins and rose again. So many of us forget that sacrifice. He risk His life so that the gain for all would be great, all we have to do is to be willing to accept the gift that He gave to us through His sacrifice. Would we be willing to be tortured and nailed to a cross, when we know that we are innocent?","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/www.crisisresponse.org\/What-Does-Sacrifice-Look-Like-3F\/"}

{"text":"The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works showed strong bipartisan support for the Utilizing Significant Emissions with Innovative Technologies (USE IT) Act in a hearing on Wednesday. Senate Bill 2602 is intended to monetize previously captured carbon. The bill - sponsored by Senators John Barasso, R-Wyo.; Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.; Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.; and Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D. - appeals to both sides of the aisle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a win-win. It\u2019s an energy bill. It\u2019s a carbon emission reduction bill and it will benefit all of us economically,\u201d said Capito.\nThe USE IT Act complements and builds off of recently-passed legislation that was introduced by the same bipartisan group of senators. The Furthering Carbon Capture, Utilization, Technology, Underground Storage, and Reduced Emissions (FUTURE) Act expanded and extended the Section 45Q tax credit for carbon capture.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now looking to the second phase and making sure that technology can make it out onto the field. Beyond economics, we need to have adequate R&D into CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage),\u201d Capito said.\nUSE IT seeks to amend Section 103 of the Clean Air Act, adding language that accommodates carbon dioxide (CO2) activities. But critics say the move could be a threat to the Clean Air Act's integrity.\nThe hearing featured testimony from Mark Northam, executive director at the University of Wyoming\u2019s School of Energy Resources; S. Julio Friedmann, CEO of Carbon Wrangler LLC; Noah Deich, executive director at the Center for Carbon Removal; and Feng Jiao, associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and associate director for the Center for Catalytic Science and Technology at the University of Delaware.\n\"In many ways, the U.S. has demonstrated prowess in fielding and managing CCUS infrastructure,\" Friedmann said. \"However, substantial shortcomings to these programs and infrastructure elements limit the market for greater uptake.\"\nThe existing CO2 pipelines are largely outdated, the great majority of them being built before 2003. Furthermore, those lines do not reach several key states necessary for transport. Senators discussed a need for expediting the pipeline permitting processes, which in one case took 54 months.\n\u201cObviously, if you\u2019re going to capture and utilize carbon dioxide, it\u2019s helpful to have a way to distribute it to the ultimate users. And that\u2019s where the pipeline piece comes in. It\u2019s a very sensible adjunct to the bill that we got passed,\u201d said Whitehouse.\nThe senators also talked about putting a price on the sales of stored carbon. The committee is looking to oil and coal stakeholders for input on the material's value. But since implementing carbon capture requires investments on the scale of billions of dollars, monetizing the stored carbon is a critical component of continuing the costly process.\n\"Carbon capture and sequestration process itself is not profitable without subsidies or carbon tax. As a critical component in CSUS, carbon utilization holds the key to generate revenues that can offset the capture cost and initial investments,\" Jiao said.\nWhile scientists hope to one day find a way to use the stored carbon as fuel for homes and vehicles, the option is not yet viable. Instead, they recommended using the material in applications such as building materials and chemicals. Many more uses are on the brink of discovery and call for further research. To facilitate those discoveries he USE IT Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency administrator to support CCUS research and development.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.agri-pulse.com\/articles\/10835-proposal-to-use-captured-carbon-a-win-win"}

{"text":"You guys, I am so behind!\nI\u2019ve had Amazon Prime for years, but I used it primarily (pun, sorry) for the free shipping, video streaming, Kindle Lending, and Prime Day sales.\nBut I was totally missing out!\nDid you know about Prime Reading? You probably do. As I said, I\u2019m behind. I recently went camping and wanted to load up my Kindle with things to read by the fire. While I was browsing, I came across this new-to-me-but maybe-not-to-the-rest-of-the-world feature and about danced a jig.\nTons of free things to read! I loaded up and took my devices to the mountains. There\u2019s nothing like relaxing by a fire in total darkness with a nice book to read.\nThe fire where actual Prime Reading took place.\nOkay, now back to Prime Reading itself. If you\u2019re already a member of the Amazon Prime program, it\u2019s included at no additional charge (unlike the Kindle Unlimited program). You don\u2019t even have to own a Kindle. All you need is a device of your choosing and the free reading apps.\nBoom! You get access to tons of books and magazines. And they are actually items you\u2019d want to read! Seriously, go look. You\u2019ll find something to enjoy or mock (whatever suits you).\nChoose your books or magazines from the Prime Reading selection.\nWhen you\u2019re done, return the item.\nYou can check out 10 items at a time! TEN!\nEven if you hate the book, you\u2019re not losing any money. It\u2019s risk-free reading from your couch. No trip to the library needed.\nI didn\u2019t know about Prime Reading, but it makes me much more willing to pay the new, higher price. And it makes me wonder what else I\u2019m missing out on.\nSo are you already using Prime Reading? If so, what should I check out next? Or are you just as behind as me?\nI\u2019m so behind also! I think I used it once last year but was confused and thought it was Kindle Unlimited. I saw the 10 books thing but didn\u2019t understand when I couldn\u2019t check out another book (which was the K-unlimited) I still probably haven\u2019t returned that first book! Ha!\nThat\u2019s exactly what I thought! I didn\u2019t know Prime Reading was a different thing. I morphed it with Kindle Unlimited and the Kindle Owner\u2019s Lending Library. There are so many ways to get lots of books for a good price!","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/bectonliterary.com\/making-the-most-of-amazon-prime-prime-reading\/"}
{"text":"Yesterday, I received the book from Amazon.com and quickly scanned the first couple of chapters \u2014 enough to convince me she\u2019s a much better writer than on-stage interviewer. On the page, she doesn\u2019t interject herself into the narrative.\nFrankly, I\u2019m typically not a fan of biographies of still active business executives \u2014 or in the case of her book, biographical vingettes strung together in a book-length \u201ctrend story.\u201d Over the years, I\u2019ve discovered that books about dead people are more instructive than books about the living. Call me old fashioned \u2014 or morbid.\nFor example, I tried really hard to like the recent book about Steve Jobs by Leander Kahney, Inside Steve\u2019s Brain. And while I found it nice that he eschewed the typical recounting of Jobs\u2019 darker side, it is still a bit flat. I was especially disappointed by what must have been a publisher\u2019s request that he put bullet-point \u201clessons from Steve\u201d at the end of each chapter.\nLesson from Inside Steve\u2019s Brain: If you want to throw cold water on a biography, end each chapter in ready-for-Power Point bullet points.

{"text":"In Aztec cosmology, the soul\u2019s journey to the Underworld after death leaves them with four destinations: the Sacred Orchard of the Gods, the Place of Darkness, the Kingdom of the Sun, and a paradise called the Mansion of the Moon. The most common deaths end up on their way to Mictl\u00e1n (Place of Darkness) with its nine levels, crashing mountains and rushing rivers, and four years of struggle. This pantheon of gods and goddesses and the expanse of the 13 Heavens provides the cultural basis for the Day of the Dead customs and celebrations.\nJos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco\u2019s monumental mural, \u2018The Epic of American Civilization,\u2019 with the panel commemorating the Aztec Underworld gods in \u2018The Coming of Quetzalcoatl (1932-34).\nThe following is provided as a lesson at a fictional school for noble boys and girls, but presents the cosmology quite comprehensively, where the manner of one\u2019s death determines their Land of the Dead destination.\nToday we will talk of Mictl\u00e1n and the other mansions of death.\nTime to start the #LeyendasMexicas.\nToday I will talk of the Four Houses of the Dead. In particular the journey we have to do while reaching Mictl\u00e1n.\nBut, before that, you need to know that Mictlantecuhtli, the skeletal Lord of the Land of the Dead is the supreme ruler of Mictl\u00e1n. He oversees the place of eternal smoke and darkness, along with his consort Mictlancihuatl.\nEl Zapotal, Veracruz, Mexico: Clay sculpture of Mictantecutli, Lord of the Land of the Dead, Mictlan, from the Totonac culture.\nAt sunset, Mictlantechutli, along with Tonatiuh, take their place upon the sun, to illuminate the world of the dead.\nTonatiuh, the Star God, becomes Tzontemoc at dusk to light the world of Mictlantecuhtli at night.\nThe legend says that, after Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca created the world, the day and night, they placed Mictalntecuhtli and his wife Mictlancihuatl as Lord and Lady of the underworld.\nThe counterpart of Mictl\u00e1n is the paradise known as Tlaloc\u00e1n, the home of the god Tlaloc, where the people dead from drowning or lightning would arrive.\nThe Chichihuacuauhco was the first mansion, the place of the dead children. In its middle there was a large tree, whose branches dripped milk, so the children could feed and gain strength.\nChichihuacuauhco: Paradise orchard of the gods, full of unique sustenance giving trees, but only available to children. Also known as Tonacacuauhtitlan, it was home to those who had died whilst still suckling.\nThese children would return to the world when the race that is inhabiting the Earth, our world of the Fifth Sun, will be destroyed. That is why their death was necessary, because they were chosen to populate the Earth in the future, when no one will be left alive.\nIt was believed that these children reincarnated after their death in this mansion, where they lived physically until they were called by the gods.\nThen Mictl\u00e1n was the second house. People who eventually succumbed to illness and old age went to Mictl\u00e1n. In order to reach it, the soul has to make a four year journey, passing through nine layers of the Underworld and various daunting tests.\nFirst, the dead would come to a place where a great river called Apanohuaya (where one crosses the river) roared along, wide and gushing, intimidating and impossible to swim across.\nTo cross it one needed the help of an Itzcuintli (xoloitzcuintle), a special dog each family raised and cremated alongside the mourned deceased.\nDogs were associated with the deity Xolotl, the god of death. The roundness of the body might suggest its value as food for the posthumous soul. Image: Xolotl from the 15th century Codex Fejervary-Mayer.\nUpon recognizing his dead master, the dog would bark, then rush to help the deceased to cross the river, carrying its master upon his back while swimming.\nAfter the crossing, the deceased was stripped of all his clothes, beginning the second part of his journey between two mountains that conflicted with each other. This pass was called Tepetl Monamiclia, and the deceased would make his way warily, haunted by the fear that the two mountains would clash, crushing the passing traveler.\nAt the end of the pass, the deceased would be forced to walk down the hill strewn with flints and sharp obsidian, made of the same material as our knives, called Ilztepetl. The stones would cut the dead them as they passed, merciless and relentless.\nThe next stage was the walk through Celhuecayan, eight mountains, covered with perpetual snow that would fall on and on, whipped by strong winds. It was said that the winds in these moors were so cold and strong it would cut the body as obsidian blades.\nAfter this the dead would arrive at the foot of the hill, the last stop in the first part of the journey called Paniecatacoyan. These moors were cold and large, where the dead would have to walk endlessly, crossing the desolated land.\nDone with the first test, the dead would take a long path, where they would be struck with arrows. This place was called Temiminaloyan and the arrows were fired by unseen hands, trying to harm the passersby.\nAt the end of the path, they would arrive at the place inhabited by thousands of fierce beasts. When any of the beasts reached them, the passersby would have to throw open their chests and let the beasts eat their hearts, Tecoylenaloyan.\nAfterwards, they would be force to dive into the Apanuiayo, where the water was black, and where the lizard called Xochilonal had lived. The dead would have to swim in this lake, dodging the animals, including the terrifying lizard to get to the next test.\nNext, they would have to wade through nine rivers, on a path of mist and dark, called Izmictlan Apochcalolca. The sun never rose in this place.\nFinally, tired, injured and exhausted with suffering, they would reach their final destination on Chicunamictlan, where they would meet Mictlantecuchtli, the fierce God of the Death, who would receive them with vengeance.\nHere the cycle would end forever and here they would live until their bodies and their lives would extinguish.\nThe long journey lasted for four years, in which the deceased came to his eternal rest.\nThis was the mansion to which came most of the dead, people who would die of natural causes.\nThe third house was the Kingdom of the Sun.\nHere the warriors, slaughtered at the hands of their enemies, would rest. Also included were the souls of those women who died in childbirth. Among the Aztecs, the pregnant woman was like a warrior who symbolically captured her child for the Aztec state in the painful and bloody battle of birth. Considered as female aspects of defeated heroic warriors, women dying in childbirth became fierce goddesses who carried the setting sun into the netherworld realm of Mictl\u00e1n.\nThis place was outside the time, a wonderful infinite place, a beautiful plain, and every time the sun would come up, they would hear the sound of the warriors beating their shields.\nAfter four years, these warriors would turn into rich bird-feathers, small, living creatures eating the flowers.\nThe iconography of Tonatiuh\u2019s attire provides a visual explanation for what his role as the sun god entailed. The deity is usually depicted with arrows and a shield to show that he is a warrior. Tonatiuh often carries a maguey spine in one hand to signify that he takes part in bloodletting practices as a means of sacrifice. The importance of sacrifice is also reinforced by depictions of balls of eagle feather or the eagle itself, which were markers of sacrifice. Tonatiuh\u2019s connection to the sun leads us to believe that the eagle is a reference to the ascending and descending eagle talons, which is a visual metaphor for capturing the heart or life force of a person. [From Townsend, Richard (1979). \u2018State and Cosmos in the Art of Tenochtitlan\u2019. Washington D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks].\nUpon the Earth, in our world of the Fifth Sun, these birds were treated with honor, because we knew they were the souls of the warriors who had died in a battle. These birds are hummingbirds. Some would also become butterflies.\nThe fourth house was what Catholics took for a paradise.\nThose who had died by drowning, lightning, and other deaths related to water and rain would arrive at Tlaloc\u00e1n, the Mansion of the Moon, a place of unending springtime and a paradise of green plants. This place belonged to Tlaloc (Nahuatl: \u201cHe Who Makes Things Sprout\u201d).\nThe dead arriving here would live happy, fresh and unconcerned. These dead were not cremated, but buried, interred with a piece of wood which was believed to sprout leaves and flowers once the person had entered Tlaloc\u00e1n. Here people enjoyed food and fruits in abundance, a luxury deserving the realm of the supreme god of rain and agriculture.\nAnd so, between those mansions the dead Mexica were divided, each person going to his designated place in the Mexican Underworld.\nThere were other pseudo-mansions to which people arrived if killed in special situations. For example, noble women dead in childbirth were going to Cihuateteo.\nMictl\u00e1n was located below our world.\nThe Ilhuuicatl-Tonatiuh was upon the sun itself.\nThe Chichihuacuahco location was unknown, but it said it was out of this world.\nAnd those were the mansions of the dead, and the journey that the dead suffered when they were in Mictl\u00e1n.\nAnd so today ends the night of #LeyendasMexicas.\nNeumann, Franke J. (1975). \u201cThe Dragon and the Dog: Two Symbols of Time in Nahuatl Religion\u201d. Numen, Vol. 22, Fasc. 1 Apr 1975. Brill Publishers: 1\u201323.\nTownsend, Richard. \u2018State and Cosmos in the Art of Tenochtitlan\u2019.

Also please email me if you have a moment to spare.\nI am comparing what I have found to known ancient gods relating to underworld, serpents, and judgement related information.\nThis looks and could be a possible, but need the information which will confirm.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.wilderutopia.com\/traditions\/mythological-journey-to-the-aztec-lands-of-the-dead\/"}
{"text":"Honestly, I\u2019m a bit eclectic and quirky. I know that I\u2019m not for everyone and I\u2019m fine with that. Everyone has different tastes. At the end of the day, I can only be thankful and appreciative for the people that have warmly responded to me. My music also has an eclectic style. I like experimenting with various sounds across several different genres: rock, pop, electronica, EDM, hip-hop. I like for every song to sound unique, be completely different, and not feel like I have to mold part of myself into something specific. I absolutely thrive on new sounds, experimental melodies, and ideas that gravitate towards something positive.\nMy latest album is called \u201cThe Charm.\u201d By far, this was my most personal and ambitious project to date. I recorded 15 new tracks. Majority of the songs are original material that draw from past experiences or ideals on various subject matters. During the conceptual phase, I thought it would be fun to be a little tongue in cheek. This is my third album and the third time is supposed to be the charm. I decided that I wanted to create songs from common catch phrases such as \u2018Ain\u2019t Nobody Got Time For That\u2019, \u2018It Gets Better\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m Just Sayin.\u2019 I wanted to create unique songs similar to individual charms hanging from a bracelet. We started experimenting with sounds and styles until the album sort of evolved. I also wanted to share a spiritual component which I think people have really started to resonate and connect with.\nI really took my time with The Charm. It took about five years to complete until I finally felt comfortable with releasing it. I feel that I have evolved as a stronger song-writer, performer, and producer. I\u2019ve found that music inspires change and heals. This album was also spiritually important to me. I wrote and recorded \u201cHelp is on the Way\u201d and \u201cIt Gets Better\u201d with the hope that these songs connect with people during difficult times. There is so much confusion and chaos in the world, but I think it\u2019s extremely important to remember the positive and miraculous moments in life. Sure, the struggle is real, but we all carry our water. I think it\u2019s important for people to realize that we are so much stronger together. We are only separated by ideology and fear.\nWe\u2019ve been working on a couple of video concepts, but I am terribly self-conscious and shy at times even though my music can get a little edgy. As a former film student, I get lost in tons of video concepts and ideas. I become torn and vacillate between projects or overly critique the work. There is a huge part of me that would absolutely love to dive further into more video production to give the music a better visual connection. I would really like to do a video for \u201cHelp is on the Way\u201d that illustrates the power of giving on multiple levels and show the many ways it comes back to us. Understandably, video also a good promotional platform. Another part of me would rather just work on new music. I feel that I always have to choose between working on video or new music. And music always wins.\nLike video, live performance is another area where I feel under developed and slightly uncomfortable. The recording studio has become kind of a sanctuary, solace, and a place to escape. In the studio, there are no rules, no pressure, and no immediate expectations. There is a definite freedom to it which is limitless. I would love to work on another album with more seasoned producers and artists. I think touring would be an absolute blast with the right partners and teams. It would be cool to develop a live set list with material from the last three albums along with some new material, but only if there was a higher level of production. I couldn\u2019t be the guy that nods and bounces around on stage with a microphone. If I touring ever became a focus, I would envision something creative with some flair.\nI\u2019m not sure that I really stand out. I\u2019d like to think that I do to some degree. We\u2019ve all seen the lines of people auditioning for shows like The Voice or America\u2019s Got Talent. Everyone is lined up with that same hope that they will stand out or that someone will notice them enough to launch them into the stratosphere. I\u2019m not going to chase Willy Wonka or go through a case of chocolate bars to find that golden ticket. Anyone can be Facebook famous. I\u2019m a little more pragmatic with my approach music for many different reasons. The Charm had songs with themes of suicide prevention, anti-bullying, and many sub themes. I\u2019ve worked hard, devoted many years, and self-financed my own projects. If I do stand out and if by chance someone notices, I\u2019d wonder what we could do with less limitations and restrictions. Either way, big budget or small, I think it will always be in my DNA to write and record new songs.\nLately, I\u2019ve been listening to Jars of Clay, Ariana Grande, Madonna (Rebel Heart and Ray of Light), and Britney Spears (Glory). I\u2019ve been listening mostly to female pop artists.\nI love the question \u201cBesides music, what gets you out of bed in the morning?\u201d I get out of bed so I can work so I can follow a budget to make more music. I think of music like an opportunity to save someone\u2019s life, heal, or inspire change even if it\u2019s for only a couple minutes or escape into something new. I am passionate for things that stimulate and challenge me intellectually, physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. I live in Vegas so there is always a reason to get out of bed and always something to do.\nI\u2019ve been recording new music which feels like starting another album. I\u2019m experimenting with more Pop, EDM, and Dance tracks. I might resume another video project or two. I\u2019m at a point in my life where I\u2019d love to say that I\u2019m getting married, but I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s in the cards.\nThanks for an awesome interview, Jason!","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.artistpr.com\/artist-interview\/artist-interview-jason-rylan\/"}

{"text":"It\u2019s that time of year, when companies have started to release their Christmas items and I love it! I\u2019ll be honest, last year I went a bit over the top with the Christmas release purchases, but this year I\u2019ve decided to only stick to items that truly catch my eye, and the Galaxy Palette by Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty range definitely did that.\nThe Galaxy Palette is a limited edition palette release, which contains 14 \u2018stardusted\u2019 shades, each with a different finish of either sheer, glittery topcoats, or smokey shimmery hues with more pigmentation as their base colour. I\u2019ll say it now \u2013 this palette does not contain ANY matte shades, so if you are one to not like a palette without mattes, then this isn\u2019t for you. Also note that this is an all glitter palette too, but with different glitter formulas so again if this isn\u2019t your type of thing, then you may want to stay away.\nI personally have no issues with the palette being all glitter. Let\u2019s be honest here, it\u2019s nothing new to the market to have an all glitter palette (Moondust by Urban Decay ring a bell?), so when I saw that Rihanna had decided to venture down this route I thought \u2018good on her\u2019. If we really think about it, the market is saturated with mattes or a mixture of mattes and shimmers, so it\u2019s great to see something different, if not necessarily new.\nNow of course when working with glitters you will have to work on your application, and this palette is no exception. Most of the shadows work best with a glitter glue to ensure they last a long time on your eyelids, otherwise you\u2019ll experience some fall out throughout the day as well as some fading (especially from the glitter topcoats).\nThe shadows with more pigmentation worked better and I found that I didn\u2019t necessarily need to use a glitter glue or even a base colour for them to show (Lightyear, Sunburst and Midnight Bolt). Some of the more interesting shades such as Space Owt and Ultraviolit, I found, had quite subtle pigmentation, so they would definitely need to be placed on top of a base eyeshadow. Another point to note is that most of these shades work best when applying with your fingers, as it\u2019s easier to pack on the glitters with less fall out.\nThe packaging of the Galaxy Palette is a real standout. I LOVE the rainbow reflective packaging of the palette itself, although it does attract finger print stains! The palette\u2019s outer packaging comes with the Fenty name written in glitter! Overall I\u2019ve enjoyed using this palette \u2013 is it something for me to reach for everyday? No. Will I repurchase this? No. But I\u2019ll definitely be making the most of it during this party season. This palette has a short shelf life of 9 months, which may be because of the glitters.\nThe Galaxy Palette retails for \u00a339, and can be found in-store and online at Harvey Nichols here.

{"text":"A series of floods took place on the Des Moines River in 1851, 1859, 1903, 1944, 1947, and 1954. In 1938 and 1944, Flood Control Acts were passed which led to a lengthy study of nine sites on the Des Moines River. Two of the sites studied were chosen for the construction of dams: Red Rock and Saylorville.\nConstruction of the Red Rock Dam began in 1960, and the dam was finished in 1969. The primary purpose of the dam is to reduce flood damage along the Des Moines River below the dam, as well as along the Mississippi River further downstream.\nThe Red Rock project cost a total of 88 million dollars. This amount was divided three ways. Approximately one-third was spent to purchase land around the site. Another third was spent to relocate 96 miles of the Wabash Railroad, 42 miles of highway, 2 miles of gas lines, 225 miles of electric lines, and 8 cemeteries. The final third was used to construct Red Rock Dam. The project was costly to build but has paid for itself many times over. By protecting property, lives, and crops, an estimated 449 million dollars had been saved during 1969 to 1999.\nThe Des Moines River Basin begins in Minnesota and extends through Iowa to the Mississippi River. The runoff from over 12,000 square miles of land drains from this basin into the Des Moines River above Lake Red Rock. The Des Moines River joins the Mississippi River at Keokuk, Iowa.\nSaylorville Dam and Red Rock Dam work together to provide flood control on the Des Moines River and Mississippi River.\nWhile the earthen segments make up most of the dam, the control structure is where the action is. Each part of the structure has a specific and important function.\nThe \"Stilling Basin\" functions to still the river water as it flows out of the dam. Slowing the water decreases bank erosion. To slow the water, large concrete blocks called \"baffles\" were placed in the basin. There are 25 baffles, each the size of a passenger van, lined up in two rows in the basin.\nThe \"Sluice Gates,\" located inside the control structure, empty into the stilling basin. There are 14 hydraulically- operated sluice gates. Each is five feet wide and nine feet tall. These gates are used when outflow is less than 38,000 cubic feet per second.\nUnlike some dams, Red Rock has a \"controlled\" spillway through the use of the \"Tainter Gates.\" Each gate is 41 feet wide and 45 feet tall. These high outflow gates are used only during high water conditions.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.mvr.usace.army.mil\/Missions\/Recreation\/Lake-Red-Rock\/About-Us\/"}

Tourism has become a huge part of modern people\u2019s lives since it offers opportunities to get to know more of unknown places. The United Kingdom\u2019s largest and capital city is London. London as one of the world's most visited cities has something for everyone. London contains four World heritage sites on UNESCO's list. London is home to many museums, sporting events, tourist attractions and cultural institutions that are interesting for numerous visitors that visit London every year. London has a diverse range of population and cultures and is famous as a multicultural city. London is a global city and also an important banking and financial centre. Its tourism is one of the prime industries that contribute to London's economy. Even though London and its population had to face many difficulties through its history, with its famous rulers it became what it is today, one of the most important tourist and financial centers in the world. The main part of this final paper is directly focused on London's history and its tourism and it shows how it became one of the most popular cities in the world and how it developed its economy.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/repozitorij.mev.hr\/islandora\/object\/mev:243"}
{"text":"In less than 50 years, the world\u2019s population has almost doubled and now reaches 7,000,000,000 people. This global milestone is both a great opportunity and a great challenge. In the world of seven billion, we all count on each other.\nUNFPA\u2019s work on population is central to the goals of the international community to improve living standards and achieve sustainable development. Population dynamics, including growth rates, age structure, fertility and mortality, migration and more, influence every aspect of human, social and economic development. Other core areas of UNFPAs work, including reproductive health and women's empowerment, powerfully influence population trends.\nLinking population factors to designing of national development programmes is especially important in Uzbekistan, which has the biggest population in Central Asia, over 30 million, according to recent estimates. For the last two decades the country\u2019s population growth has slowed considerably, from almost 2% in the 1990s to 1.3% in the period 2000-2007. The country faced significant decline in total fertility rate \u2013 from 4.6 in the beginning of the 1990s to the current rate of 2.6.\nAnother important factor that the country faces in recent years is external labour migration. In addition, despite strenuous government\u2019s efforts to curb human trafficking, especially targeting women, it remains a serious problem.\nThus, UNFPA supports Uzbekistan in improving capacity of the government at central and local level to collect, analyze and use population data for formulation of socio-economic development strategies and promote understanding of the linkages between population issues and development.\nUNFPA-supported Survey Analyzes the Role of Families in Uzbekistan, in Times of Transition.\nSince Uzbekistan gained independence in 1991, the evolution of family relations during the transition to market economy has been closely followed. While new realities put new challenges in front of men and women, older and younger generations, the cultural traditions still greatly affect gender and age-based roles and responsibilities in Uzbek families.\nThe survey supported by UNFPA is first in quite a while to look at the issues of family relations, family and reproductive choices of young people, family budgets and distribution of incomes, as well as roles of men and women, parents and children in family-related decision-making. The survey was among the first to explore the sensitive issue of gender-based violence and analyze the typical causes and ways of settling family conflicts.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/uzbekistan.unfpa.org\/en\/node\/9673"}

{"text":"Mercedes-Benz has been in the ascendancy in recent years. In the past its appetite for fleet business had been patchy, and, unlike BMW and Audi, it was seen as a brand that was more focused on retail sales.\nEven as recently as five years ago, Mercedes-Benz was a distant third in the premium car sales rankings in the UK, behind BMW and Audi.\nA new strategy emerged in 2010, and the brand has achieved significant growth since. With a target of overtaking both Audi and BMW, which looks increasingly likely as we approach the end of 2016, the business of driving growth in fleet now falls to Rob East.\nEast became head of fleet for Mercedes-Benz passenger cars in July, having previously been national fleet sales manager. He joined parent company Daimler in 2009 and spent time at Smart and the Mercedes-Benz Driving Academy.\nIn his previous role, he led a team of strategic account managers to record-breaking fleet sales in 2016, and now East is set to smash those records again as head of fleet.\nHe does, however, ensure credit is given to his predecessors Nick Andrews and Sally Dennis for the brand\u2019s huge improvement in performance in fleet and business sales.\n\u201cBefore 2010 we were very inconsistent in fleet,\u201d he says. \u201cPost-2011 our doors were opened for business with fleets, and we ensured we were easy to do business with, behaved with consistency, and began a great product assault.\nThe introduction of new models, expanding growth across a broader base, has allowed Mercedes-Benz to maximise volume while limiting its impact on residual values forecasts, ensuring demand for new model lines would also be created among used car buyers.\nThe revamped A-Class has much greater appeal than the previous generations, while the company has also added the CLA with four-door and \u2018shooting brake\u2019 estate versions, as well as the GLA crossover and B-Class using the same platform. A crossover based on the B-Class is also expected.\nBut although Mercedes-Benz has had its sights set on becoming the number one premium brand, it hasn\u2019t been checking out the opposition and crunching numbers on the hoof for short-term tactical gains.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.fuelcardservices.com\/increased-fleet-focus-helps-mercedes-benz-home-no1-slot\/"}

{"text":"One of the movers and shakers of the sci-fi genre, Soviet filmmaker Pavel Klushantsev is often referred to as the \u201cGodfather of Star Wars\u201d.\nThe director of the 1958 film \u201cRoad to the Stars\u201d and 1962\u2019s \u201cPlanet of Storms\u201d prompted Stanley Kubrick to shoot \u201c2001: Space Odyssey\u201d, which subsequently inspired Georges Lucas to create his famous fantasy space opera.\nLucas believed the secret to film is that it is an illusion \u2013 a flight of fancy.\nAs a special-effects pioneer, Klushantsev had the talent of turning illusions into powerful works of cinematic art, cutting through time and space with unparalleled creativity, authenticity and style.\nKlushantsev created a number of breakthrough special effects \u2013 according to film buffs, around 300 techniques \u2013 and shooting methods, including the so-called \u201cfluorescent shooting\u201d which enabled him to film objects \u201changing in the air\u201d in a film studio, by using special paint and light, creating an optical illusion of virtual realities of outer space.\nThe revolutionary Soviet filmmaker managed to hide routine \u201cauxiliary means\u201d like wires, ropes and props, from viewers\u2019 eyes, gaining sought-after authenticity.\nOne of his most famous sci-fi adventures \u201cPlanet of Storms\u201d revolved around three Soviet spaceships on their way to Venus. One of them is destroyed, but the other two successfully land on the planet. Before the cosmonauts reunite, they come to grips with scary monsters, a volcanic eruption, and alien life full of fears.\nThe iconic Soviet film served as a \u201ccreative playground\u201d for Peter Bogdanovich's 1968 \u201cVoyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women\u201d and Curtis Harrington's \u201cVoyage to the Prehistoric Planet\u201d.\nDecades later, when Georges Lucas was in Moscow during the time of perestroika, he asked the authorities to help him meet Klushantsev. When the officials replied that his name did not ring a bell, Lucas allegedly answered: \u201cHe\u2019s the Godfather of Star Wars\u201d.\nOne of film\u2019s true greats, Klushantsev worked on inventing the new resources in film which could enable him to create galaxies, starships, aliens, and robots that did not look fake from top to bottom.\nParadoxically enough, Klushantsev was one of Russia\u2019s most underestimated foremost filmmakers. Mazurov told RT why the filmmaker \u2013 who was always ahead of his time \u2013 was neglected in his own country.\nHe was keen to create unconventional sci-fi adventures that could excite and motivate the imagination of people, especially the young ones.\nHis childhood dream was to become a writer. The dream, however, did not come true until much later, when Klushantsev already made a name for himself as a filmmaker and director of photography.\nSpecial effects artist and film historian Robert Skotak, who has won two Academy Awards for \u201cThe Terminator\u201d and \u201cAliens\u201d, reportedly came to Russia back in the nineties to ask Klushantsev about his signature shooting techniques. The filmmakers met in St. Petersburg where Klushantsev allegedly shared a selection of his unique special effects with his American counterpart.\nThe guru of visual effects had an eye for innovation and originality, though he died almost blind at the age of 89.\nAristotle said that time crumbles things. Despite stunning visual effects and trailblazing shooting techniques, apparently Klushantsev\u2019s epics also have their sell-by-date and, according to film buffs like Mazurov, have failed to pass the test of time.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/klushantsev-lucas-kubrick-planet\/"}

{"text":"Welcome! Have you ever been RV-ing at Fort Wilderness in Walt Disney World? I am going to share the advantages, activities, and tips when staying at Fort Wilderness.\nOver the past 30 years, we have been to Disney just over 20 times but for the first time, January 2017, we took our RV. We stayed at Disney\u2019s Fort Wilderness Campground and had one of the best vacations ever.\nMy first advice when staying on-site at Disney World?\nThis advice is not just for staying at Fort Wilderness but for all Disney World properties. YOU NEED TO BOOK EARLY, and as soon as Disney allows you to book. The vacation we took in January of this year was scheduled exactly a year earlier in January 2016. Starting the second week in January is usually the slow time for Disney World, but we found out this is not true for Fort Wilderness.\nWe were supposed to check into Fort Wilderness on Monday the second week of January. On Wednesday, snow was still being predicted for the Little Rock area for Thursday and Friday with sleet and or freezing rain for Saturday. If you need an excuse to start your vacation early, snow, sleet or freezing rain while driving an RV is all the reason I need. We got up before the rooster crowed, NO, we do not live in the country, and headed to Disney.\nThe first day we arrived was only 55 degrees but the rest of the week was PERFECT 68 TO 78 degrees with no rain. Disney World in January had the best weather we have ever had in over 20 times we have been to Disney.\nI called on the way down there to get an overnight stay at an Alabama campground and called to see if we could check in early at Fort Wilderness. Unfortunately, they were all full. We could not check in until Monday. Fort Wilderness has 28 camping loops. I guess each loop has between 30 to 60 camping spots in it but no room left in the Inn for us. However, we did find another very nice campground in Kissimmee called Tropical Palms RV Resort to stay at until Monday morning. We got to Fort Wilderness campground check-in early Monday and were able to get to our campsite before check-in.\nWe found out that Disney was hosting a Marathon the second weekend in January and people had flocked in to run in Disney before the park opened. After checking in Fort Wilderness, we meet several retirees that were staying at Fort Wilderness campground for the entire winter. LUCKY! I did stop to think how much fun it would be to stay the whole winter.\nHow much does Fort Wilderness cost?\nTo stay the second week in January, it was right at $100 a night. You can see the rates here for other times of the year.\nIs it worth the money to RV at Fort Wilderness?\nYes, it is! Fort Wilderness is a Disney property which means you get all the perks of staying at a Disney Resort.\nBecause you are staying on a Disney property, you have free transportation to the parks. Boat transportation will take you directly to the Magic Kingdom, Disney\u2019s Wilderness Lodge and Disney\u2019s Contemporary Resort. The boat runs every 20 minutes. You can easily enjoy a meal at Disney Fort Wilderness Lodge or have breakfast at Chef Mickey\u2019s in the Contemporary Resort. Even if you are not going to Magic Kindom, you can take the short boat ride and hop on board the monorail to many other Disney Resorts.\nThe bus also runs every 20 minutes to Epcot, Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, Disney Springs and even the Water Parks.\nWe could stay at Fort Wilderness Campground and never leave the property. The activities are endless.\nAmenities \u2013 The bath house was located between loop 100 and 200.\nThe bath house is not only super clean all the time, but it is very safe. It is not your typical campground bathhouse. After all, we are talking about Disney World it is not your average campground.\nAs you saw in the picture on the first page, the laundry facility was clean too. I can tell you from first-hand experience. With a family of six plus my mother-in-law staying with us, I ended up doing laundry twice. I filled several washers up the night before we were going home. The washers and dryers do not take coins. You will have to insert your credit card.\nThe view from the bathhouse to our site. Notice all the trees. This picture was taken the second week in January. I can imagine summer has, even more, privacy. Each site is hidden in the trees.\nWhich camping sites or camping loops do I recommend?\nIn my opinion, the best place to camp at Fort Wilderness is as close as you can to the marina. Sections 100, 200, or 400 are the closest to the beach, marina, restaurants, fishing, boat rentals, nightly fireworks, and a nightly boat parade. It is a very short walk to take advantage of all these activities from section 100, 200, and 400. Loop 100 was full when we checked in, so we stayed in loop 200. It was on the inside, but it was the second site from the end which had a huge advantage. Because the campsite was on the end of the loop, it was super close to the extra clean bathhouse.\nWhen staying at Fort Wilderness, be sure to decorate your campsite. We took all our Disney\u2019s Characters and placed them in the window of our RV. We also had Disney light ups. Picture below. A lot of sites go all out especially during Christmas. Since we were staying the second week in January, a lot of camping sites still have Christmas lights up.\nWhen we checked into the campground, we were warned not to touch or feed the wildlife. My first thought was \u201cyeah right.\u201d The campground is in the middle of Disney World where you can find millions of people and probably thousands in Fort Wilderness, and he is warning us about wildlife. We did not even get to the first stop sign, and we saw four or five deer standing on the side of the road. They were just eating not even caring that we are a pretty big RV sitting right next to them. Seriously, Fort Wilderness Campground has trees everywhere with lots of wildlife.

{"text":"CHEMICAL REACTION: There are certain conditions under which fuels will not create a flame, even though fuel, temperature and oxygen are present. For example , if the percentage of natural gas in air is not between about 4 percent and 15 percent, zero flame will be produced; your fire pit will not go! The burning process can be specified by an examination of the flame of a candle. The wax does not burn straight, but , rather, gas radiated by the heated wax moves up the wick and burns up. Prove this by coming out a candle that has been burning for some time. Then cross a lighted match through the trail of smoke growing from the wick. A flame will travel down the use to the wick and relight the candle. There are three areas in the flame manufactured by fire pits: (1) the dark inner area of zero combustion and (2) a great intermediate layer of partial combustion, composed of hydrogen and carbon monoxide that gradually work their way to (3) the outside cone of whole combustion.\nToutlemaghreb - Removing the pajero intercooler mitsubishi pajero owners.

{"text":"What have you done since graduating in 2010?\nSince graduating I have interned with menswear designers Martine Rose, Christopher Shannon and then back to Martine because she was lovely to work with! However, I grew a little disheartened with interning as I felt I was pretty much doing the same thing. So, I decided to take things into my own hands and began showcasing my collection at each worthy opportunity. Internet has been particularly useful for gaining attention. I have slowly established my label, there\u2019s still a long way to go and so much to learn but I\u2019m on my way now!\nI would say the most important skills that I learned during my time stydying at Fashion Design Rochester were the technical ones such as garment construction and pattern cutting. Without knowing how to cut patterns and construct garments I wouldn\u2019t have been able to successfully design and make my collections and would have had to pay a lot of money for people to do the work for me.\nThe course trained me how to design my own collection and how to present it. The research and design process, utilising your research effectively, having the ability to be critical about your designs \u2013 deciding which ones to bring forward into a cohesive collection that you will present is very important. Through presentations and critiques, I learned how to present and speak about my work confidently. These are things that you will have to do after university to people in and outside of the fashion industry, it has be invaluable for me to know what to do and how to present my brand in these situations.\nYes, Rochester was a great welcoming and friendly university. The environment is comfortable which I think is important aspects as you will be there for 3 years. The University has a great range of tools, machinery as well as technology, programs and software and printing facilities \u2013 we were never short of anything that we needed.\nFor current students I would say to use your time well, go to every lesson and every lecture. Soak up and make good use of everything around you because you will miss it once you leave. I would advice potential future students that both university and to work in the fashion industry is hard work so make sure you know that this is what you want and you have the drive and passion to see you through challenging times.

{"text":"Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s incumbent government races to the elections in 2019, their flagship programme, the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), has shown a mixed bag of results according to the Sharada Prasada Committee report on Skill India.\nAfter the programme was launched in July 2015, Rs 1,500 crore was allotted for its purposes. The goal, then, was to impart training in industry-relevant skills for immediate employment to 2.4 million needy youth.\nDisregarding the number of those who were merely being reskilled for alignment of competencies to current practices, the nodal authority, the National Skill Development Council (NSDC), exceeded its target by completing coaching for 1.8 million people and certifying another 1.2 million people in the first year itself.\nIn 2016, a revamped version of the KVY was launched. This programme aimed at providing training to 10 million young people by 2020 and carried a budget of Rs 12,000 crore. However, data has shown that only 1.4 million people were trained by the NSDC under the reward programme, while 0.9 million people were certified and 0.1 million people were actually placed. That makes up just 8.5% of those who underwent the skilling programmes.\nThe Skill India mission is pledged to facilitate the entry of 104.62 million new employees into the industry by 2022. The NSDC exceeded its target of training 2.4 million youth in various short-term skill courses in the first year (2015) but fell short in the second year. A very low percentage of learners were actually placed. The reasons have been attributed to excessive targets and the short-term skills the programme laid emphasis upon.\nHence, to meet the targets of the Skill India mission and alleviate the gap between skills and labour supply, a more holistic approach encompassing longer-term skills and combinations with career-spanning competencies are needed.\nFurther, the government must include their project partners in policymaking so that the gap between ground reality and policy can be minimised and maximum benefit can be reaped against the resources (time, money, energy) invested.\nThe Niti Aayog has correctly pointed out that a more engaging way to measure skill development indicators is urgently required to accurately gauge where our society stands today.\nThe government hopes to build vast banks of employable workers rapidly and in a standard manner by strengthening institutions and infrastructure, exploring synergies between the government and industry and roping in overseas stakeholders and facilitators.\nThe same policies also envision re-skilling 400 million people by 2022. However, it has also been underlined by various surveys conducted among the youth for whom the programme was meant that certifications and skills do not match their aspirations or their aptitudes.\nTo resolve this dilemma, it has been suggested, that employability skills and attitudes be inculcated in schoolgoing children from a very early age. Our youth need to understand that professions require hard work, patience and one may be required to perform a lot of labour while striving to reach the career path one is best suited to. Varied experiences of different trades will only help shape their character and give them something to fall back should they fail in the venture closest to their hearts.\nChildren need to be made to understand that no value is created from scratch and that hard work is rewarded by applying the psychology of instant rewards or punishment in the form of loss. That way, when these children reach working age, a culture of working-for-a-living and corresponding work-reward correlations would have been innately formed.\nAt the same time, one cannot absolve the government of its failure to conduct adequate research and make skilling programmes relevant to actual demand in the industry. Where technical skills are increasingly likely to be automated in the future, it makes no sense to train youth to perform traditional assembly line functions.\nKnowledge of digital systems and how they are likely to affect trades and vocations in the present is essential if the skilling programme is to remain relevant and last the learner a lifetime by helping her learn how to learn herself.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.deccanherald.com\/opinion\/panorama\/skill-india-lacking-holistic-719644.html"}

{"text":"I am often asked how to make almond milk at home. I use almond milk frequently in my recipes, especially when I am looking for something on the lighter side compared to coconut milk. Plus, almonds are a nutritionally dense food with proven health benefits to add to a SuperLife! This recipe is as simple as it gets. The first time you trying making homemade almond milk it can take a little getting used to. However, once you get past the hurdle of finally trying it, you will see how easy it really is! The taste and wholesome goodness of almond milk cannot be beat, and I think you will agree after making it!\n1 cup soaked organic, raw almonds, or other soaked nuts of choice. For reasons why it is important to soak your almonds (and instructions for soaking nuts), check out this blog.\nThe water will be murky in the morning, filled with anti-nutrients and starches.\nRinse the almonds well with clean, distilled water.\nLook at the difference soaking makes! Moist, plump almonds, versus dry, shriveled ones.\nPlace a fine-sieve strainer, nut milk bag (shown), or a cheesecloth over a bowl or pitcher. Make sure it is secure.\nPlace 1 cup soaked almonds with 4 cups distilled water in a blender of choice (a Vitamix is shown).\nBlend water and almonds together for about 1 minute.\nStrain the almond milk using a fine-sieve strainer, nut milk bag, or a cheesecloth. Pour the liquid in slowly. It will begin to drain into the pitcher or bowl by itself, then gently squeeze all the remaining milk out of the nut milk bag or cheese cloth with your hands.\nThe leftover solids can be dehydrated and processed into a meal to use in gluten-free breads and so on. It is possible to use EVERYTHING!\nYou can drink the almond milk plain or blend in 1 tsp honey, stevia, or yacon and \u00bd tsp vanilla extract (or fresh vanilla bean), cardamom, or cinnamon. You can add all or just some of the listed ingredients. What sounds delicious to you? Use immediately or store in an airtight glass container in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.

{"text":"If you have laptop, and it\u2019s a Mac, you may feel like Apple is the only place to turn for parts and repairs. But since 2002, Powerbookmedic.com has been offering an alternative. The site specializes in installations, repairs, parts, and service for many portable Apple devices. What started out on eBay in 1998 has quickly established itself with its own site.\nBradley Wallace owns the company, Powerbookmedic.com.\nPeC: Your company is an online business that sells replacement Mac parts and also offers Mac repair services. How do you coordinate repair services online?\nWALLACE: We\u2019ve developed a three-step process with an in-house developed application. First, anyone can go to our site and request a quote. Then, if the customer agrees to the quote, we\u2019ll provide the shipping information to send the unit to us. Finally, we\u2019ll collect the customer\u2019s payment.\nPeC: Customers can monitor the status of their repairs through support tickets. How does this system work?\nWALLACE: We use Kayako and it\u2019s similar to a system where your customers can go in and they can submit a ticket that basically goes to customer service. It assigns them a ticket number and all the responses have a ticket number associated with them.\nPeC: How do customers typically find you?\nWALLACE: We have lots of advertising campaigns from magazines to pay per click. We\u2019ve found a mixed strategy that works well for our niche market.\nPeC: As far as pay-per-click, which search engines do you use?\nWALLACE: We use Google, MSN and Yahoo!.\nPeC: How many keywords do you purchase?\nWALLACE: We purchase thousands of keywords and keyword combinations.\nPeC: What percentage of your business comes from PPC?\nWALLACE: A large amount, however the majority of our ad spend is also in PPC.\nPeC: What pay-per-click advertising advice would you have for people who are new to the world of PPC?\nWALLACE: Be aware of when it gets to the point where you feel like you can\u2019t manage it yourself. We actually hired a company to manage it for us. We have so many keywords and we just don\u2019t have the in-house employees to work on it. And we needed someone working on it 24\/7. It\u2019s expensive, but it pays off.\nPeC: Who do you use for this?\nPeC: What is your most common Mac repair job?\nWALLACE: We see a lot of everything. Cracked LCDs are probably the most common.\nPeC: What\u2019s the toughest repair job?\nWALLACE: Bottom cases of laptops that require complete disassembly. It\u2019s not really that they\u2019re tough, it\u2019s that they are long repairs.\nPeC: What is your most common Mac part sold?\nWALLACE: Power adapters, specifically our brand.\nPeC: How do you ship your parts to customers?\nWALLACE: We primarily use FedEx Express, not ground service.\nPeC: What is the biggest obstacle in repairing a Mac from a distance?\nWALLACE: The biggest challenge would be gaining the trust of a customer, which is hard to do for any e-tailer. Convincing someone to send his or her \u201cbaby\u201d off to be repaired can be hard for even the most trusting person. However, as we\u2019ve grown and become a recognizable name in our community, those trust issues have greatly diminished. Also, having a professional website invokes confidence from the customer.\nPeC: What advice would you offer other ecommerce merchants as they are getting started?\nWALLACE: Invest in the best, most customizable software available at the start of the business. This will save headaches with transfers and upgrades in the future. Avoid free systems.\nPeC: What are some of the biggest mistakes you\u2019ve made with the business?\nWALLACE: Perhaps the largest mistake is being overly cautious and being slightly reserved with company growth.\nPeC: Do you use a Mac?","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.practicalecommerce.com\/High-Performer-Powerbookmedic-com-Parts-and-Repairs-For-Mac-Laptops"}

{"text":"And yes, you should bother to have social media KPIs.\nThere are a couple reasons why more and more smart companies insist on using them.\nThe first is that many businesses now see the potential value of acquisition and retention that social media may bring to their business and want to amplify it.\nThe second, and more probable, is that social media now costs more money than it used to and businesses want to know where that money is being spent. The cost of a social media team, advertising spend, artwork, video and promotions can easily exceed $10,000 per month and that cost needs to be accounted for.\nWhich Social Media KPIs Should I Measure?\nThis is the most obvious social media KPI but still one to include. You can set a KPI around the number of people following you on social media to make sure your fan base is growing according to your expectations.\nFor example, at Contentworks, we aim to organically grow our fans by 50 each month and our handy Agorapulse report shows that we are hitting on average 151 per month.\nIt is important to remember that your social media KPIs should be reviewed each year. A 50 per month fan growth is great for a brand with 4000 followers but it wouldn\u2019t be for one with 100,000!\nWeb traffic is a really important KPI because much of your social media marketing will be geared up to drive traffic to your website. Is it working?\nWhat percentage of the traffic to your website is coming from social media? If you\u2019re investing time and effort into your social media content, you\u2019ll want to make sure that your web traffic number reflects that otherwise, why are you doing it?\nIf you have access to your website\u2019s analytics panel then you can easily check the performance of your social media channels and what they are bringing to the table. If you are running paid ads in Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn then you will also be able to see the number of clicks to your website.\nIf you want to take it one step further, you will then go on to look at the bounce and conversion rates but we will come to that later.\nAh, my least favorite measurement\u2026 impressions. Impressions show how many times your post showed up in someone\u2019s newsfeed. This could simply be because someone they know has liked or shared your post.\nThe problem with impressions is that they don\u2019t really mean that someone has actually looked at your post or even noticed it. Perhaps they scrolled right on by. Reach is a bit like the CPI (cost per impression) metric. CPI basically charges for every time your ad is shown to someone but doesn\u2019t factor in any response or action from their side.\nIf you focus on followers, be sure to segregate organic from paid ones. You need to know how much each new follower cost you and weigh up the overall worth of that fan. Certain regions cost more per fan. While those fans might more to acquire via social media, they may also spend more money on your site. That\u2019s why you need to be on top of your follower KPIs.\nEngagement measures the amount of likes, shares, tags and comments that your channel receives. It measures the \u201csocial\u201d in social media.\nHaving a large reach with low engagement is a bad sign because it indicates that your content is not resonating with your audience. Statistically, anything over 1% is considered to be a good engagement rate and there are a number of engagements you can measure.\nPost likes show engagement and also help your page to receive a preferential spot in the channel\u2019s algorithm. They also encourage more fans to visit as they will see that their friends have liked a post.\nLink clicks are a great content based KPI which will show you how interesting your headlines and post content actually is. Remember though, that a high number of link clicks with a low number of shares or conversions may mean that the content at the end of your link didn\u2019t quite deliver.\nGreat content sparks conversation. Even if your fans don\u2019t agree with your posts, at least you will spark a debate! Silence is the worst thing to have on your posts so monitoring comments is a great KPI.\nGetting shares, especially organically, is a great accolade for a social media manager. Unlike a mindless \u201clike,\u201d a share shows that your fan has taken a very decisive action. The same goes for retweets on Twitter. You definitely want to be aiming for more of this. Be careful when adding it as a KPI though, as increasing comments can be a tough call and your metrics might not move for a while.\nWhen a fan or another page tags your page, it shows that you are relevant and being talked about! While you can use brand mentions as a KPI, you should be aware that many businesses don\u2019t get any at all! If, however, you have a popular product, are running events, or are actively running a campaign, then you may want to monitor this one.\nThese engagement metrics apply across most social media channels and make great KPIs. You can see from the above screenshot of my Twitter engagement, that the Agorapulse reporting panel will allow you to monitor all of them!\nNow for the serious bit and the part you know your bosses and shareholders want to see \u2014 the leads.\nTo ensure you are getting the best ROI (return on investment) from your social media, you have to ask the tough question: How many of these engaged and happy fans are actually buying from your company?\nIf you are monitoring this yourself, then the best way is to set up your Google Analytics Conversions feature. For more information on setting up goals in Analytics, you can read this tutorial from Google.\nYou can also help yourself by creating campaign URLs for each paid social media campaign. I like the Google URL creator as it makes it easy to input my campaign and create a custom URL. Ideally you should do this for each channel so you can track your leads.\nThis process can help you decide which channel and which campaign is getting the best ROI and therefore which one you should spend more on next time.\nYou can also use Agorapulse to add UTM tracking directly to each post you share.\nWhen you set your post up for publication, just toggle on UTM tracking. Here, you can add your parameters and set your link up for tracking without ever exiting the Agorapulse dashboard.\nThis can really streamline your set up process and help you maximize ROI.\nYour business will want to look at its overall funnel to detect successes and blockages. For example, if your social media campaign receives a high engagement rate, high clickthroughs, high sign ups but a poor purchase rate then there may be an issue with the sales funnel. The sooner you identify the problem, the better\u2013 but you have to start tracking KPIs to find out.\nUnlike Leads, Conversions tell you whether your fan actually made a purchase.\nThe longer and more diluted your funnel, the more difficult it is to track and assign KPIs due to the different departmental involvements.\nIn the second example, where the customer failed to purchase, is that your responsibility as a social media manager? I would say no but I can assure you that sales will disagree.\nConversion can be a tough one to measure and will require clear interdepartmental communication. That said, it is essential to keep track of your overall conversion KPIs or at least ensure that one department is doing it and feeding the information back to you.\nRemember, Agorapulse has all the tools for easy reporting and impressive social media KPI based presentations that your company will love!\nSo now you understand which social media KPIs you should track, it\u2019s over to you. Which ones do you think are important? Comment below and let us know your thoughts.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.agorapulse.com\/blog\/social-media-kpis"}

{"text":"Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when OptimizeRx (OPRX) reports results for the quarter ended September 2018. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +116.7%.\nRevenues are expected to be $5.28 million, up 70.3% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 100% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for OptimizeRx?\nFor OptimizeRx, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that OptimizeRx will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that OptimizeRx would post a loss of $0.02 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.02, delivering a surprise of +200%.\nOptimizeRx doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/optimizerx-oprx-q3-earnings-preview-143102854.html"}

{"text":"In August of this year I had the opportunity to fly out to the East Coast on two separate weekends to teach some clinics. Both clinics were very successful. On my return flights back home to the Seattle area I reflected on what made each class such a success. The common thread for both of the classes was chaos. I love the word chaos and what we can learn from it. My trusty Webster\u0092s dictionary defines chaos as \"A state of things where chance is supreme\" or \"the inherent unpredictability in the behavior of a natural system\" or \"a state of utter confusion.\"\nLet me begin by saying, \"I believe chaos is a state of mind.\" What is chaotic to one person may not be confusing to another. Even though circumstances and\/or conditions may be unpredictable and random, it doesn\u0092t mean we cannot be comfortable in them. All too often, one associates chaos with feeling out of control. You may not be able to control what is coming at you (rarely can we control the outside world) but you do have the ability to control how you react to it. That is one the purposes of learning and mastering ones skills.\nLet\u0092s take a brief look at the typical learning scenario. Our first kayak experience is usually in very controlled calm conditions. Like many outdoor sports there are certain basic skills one needs before going out into the real world. One of the great dangers (or excitements) is kayaking happens in a dynamic environment that is always changing. As a beginner we look for the most control we can find so we spend our time upright rather than swimming all day. A good kayaking instructor is going to be teaching you skills that work in calm water or rough water. Before you can take that skill into rough water you need to perfect it on calm water. That is why most classes take place on calm water. When I teach my clinics I am often asked if we can do the clinic on open water in rough conditions. My standard reply is, \"even though there is a lot of learning that can occur in chaos, I cannot effectively teach a group in rough conditions. I can monitor them and oversee them but the teaching needs to be done in a controlled environment.\" The key to understanding my stock answer is to realize the difference between teaching and learning. As an experiential educator I embrace the following: \"What I hear I forget, what I see I remember, what I do I know.\" I feel one needs to know what they are doing in calm conditions before they try to do it in chaotic conditions.\nWhen I have the opportunity to take a group I know into chaotic conditions, it is with the understanding they will be working on skills they already know how to do on flat water. I also look for what I refer to as a \"controlled chaotic environment.\" The conditions appear to be rough and scary but the adverse consequences are low and the risk of injury is very low. Let us not forget that chaos is a state of mind. All I need is for the student to feel the conditions are chaotic.\nThe Rhode Island Clinic took place off of a beach that had two sets of rocks less than 100 yards off shore. Between the rocks was a rock free area with a sandy bottom. The east rocks had a rock tail that went toward shore. The swells were coming between the two rocks at an angle so you would eventually wash up on the rock tail if you just drifted. The swells and the wind added the right amount of chaos to the day. Before we launched I told the group the plan and said, \"we would regroup on shore after a skill set and debrief the exercise.\" We had three instructors for four pairs of students. I have to say I always like to see the looks on student\u0092s faces when they first enter chaos and are told to do the skill. As a warm up I yelled out, \"roll them if you got em.\" The look I saw in their eyes said, \"are you crazy, here and now?\" It was interesting to see how the incoming steepening swells affected one\u0092s ability to perform a successful roll. The day was spent practicing recoveries and towing options. There were repeated visits to the beach for debriefs, rest breaks and teaching. The original teaching of the skills being performed this day with this group was done in years past during previous clinics. Today was a time for really learning the skills and adding some fine-tuning. At the end of the day I can say that the initial feeling of chaos became one of familiarity for most of the group. Some were even comfortable getting to a felling of play.\nThe Long Island New York clinic provided a protected place to teach and practice skills with the opportunity to go out into the wind and wind waves to practice what was done in the calm area. What added to the feeling of chaos was the torrential rain that was falling. We followed the same game plan as the previous week. After playing in chaos we would paddle back to the calm for debrief and then review the next set of skills before taking them back on the road. It was great to see the skill improvement and increased self-confidence in the students at the end of the day. My greatest enjoyment was one of the participants resting on his extended paddle sculling brace with a giant smile on his face as he was being bounced around by the waves. He was shouting out, \"I love this stroke.\" He later confessed that before the class he would have never gone out in conditions such as these and couldn\u0092t conceive he would be resting comfortably in them. As a side note, the rain added another learning factor to the mix. The heavy rain with the wind really gave the participants a chance to see how well they were dressed for the day. We did have to send one in early because they were chilled. The rest said they were ok. However, when we went to the diner for dinner after the class, it was interesting that I ordered a cold Dr. Pepper while everyone else was asking for hot tea or hot coffee. The operative word was hot. In addition one of our group asked that the air conditioning be turned off.\nThe chaos factor for both of these clinics was what made the clinic very successful. The students were pushing their limits. They started in chaos with a real sense of trying to survive. After going back into the chaos a number of times the feeling of survival was turning toward levels of understanding the chaos. With an understanding of chaos there comes a level comfort. Some even got to the level of having fun playing in chaos. Once you know you can depend on your skills you can start to look around and look for the patterns in the so-called chaos. Once patterns are identified the conditions move out of the realm of chaotic because they are no longer unpredictable. Once you learn the rhythms of once perceived chaotic conditions you can begin to relax and enjoy the excitement.","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/www.useakayak.org\/reflections\/reflec_chaos__10_06.html"}

Its origin and authorship, its antiquity, its wonderful preservation in the midst of the unparalleled and continuous opposition which sought to destroy it, as well as its diversity and teaching, make the Bible the most wonderful book in existence.\nThose who will make a study of the Bible plan will be fully convinced of the conclusive evidence of the credibility of the Sacred Scriptures, which is furnished in the purity, harmony and grandeur of its teachings.\nOur first definite information with reference to the Sacred Writings is afforded by the direction given to Moses to write the law and history in a book, and put it in the side of the ark for preservation. (See Exod. 17:14; 34:27; Deut. 31:9-26.) This book was left for the guidance of the people. Additions were made to it from time to time by subsequent writers, and in the days of the kings, scribes appear to have been appointed whose business it was to keep a careful record of the important events occurring in Jewish history, which records\u2014Samuel, Kings, Chronicles\u2014were preserved and subsequently incorporated with the Law.\nThe Jewish copyists regarded these documents with great veneration. A very slight error in copying often led them to destroy it and begin anew. Josephus says that through all the ages that had passed none had ventured to add to, take away from, or transpose, aught of the Sacred Writings.\nOne of the strongest evidences of the authenticity of the O.T. Scriptures is found in the fact that the law and the prophets were continually referred to by our Lord and the apostles as authority, and that while the Lord denounced the corruptions of the Jewish Church, and their traditions, by which they made void the Word of God, he did not even intimate any corruption in these Sacred Writings, but commends them, and refers to and quotes them in proof of his claims.\nIn fact, the various parts of the entire book are bound together by the mutual endorsement of the various writers, so that to reject one is to mar the completeness of the whole. Each book bears its own witness and stands on its own evidence of credibility, and yet each book is linked with all the rest, both by their common spirit and harmony and by their mutual endorsement. Mark, for instance, the endorsement of the account of creation in the commandment of the law concerning the Sabbath day.\u2014Exod. 20:11. Also compare Deut. 23:4,5; Joshua 24:9; Micah. 6:5; 2 Pet. 2:15; Jude 11-13; Isa. 28:21; Hab. 3:11; Matt. 12:40.\nAnd even at that early date it contained the same books as at present with the exception of the Second Epistle of Peter, the Third Epistle of John, Jude and the Book of Revelation. And these omitted books we know were written about the close of the first century, and probably had not been widely circulated among the Christian congregations at that time.\nThe first five books of the N.T. are historical, and present a clear and connected account of the life, character, circumstances, teachings and doings of Jesus of Nazareth, who claimed to be the Messiah promised in the O.T. Scriptures, and who fully substantiated his claim. The four accounts of the Evangelists, though they differ in phraseology, are in harmony in their statements, some important items being recorded by each which seem to have been overlooked by the others. These Evangelists testified to that of which they had positive knowledge. The Apostle John says: That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you\u2014\u201dthat which was from the beginning (the beginning of the Lord\u2019s ministry), which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the Word of life; for the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness.\u201d (1 John 1:1-3.) They testify also that they saw Christ after his resurrection. The fifth book [the Book of Acts] presents a valuable account of the doings of the Apostles after their anointing with the Holy Spirit, of the establishment of the Christian Church, and of the first preaching of the good news to the Gentiles.\nThe original copies of both the Old and New Testaments have, of course, long since disappeared, and the oldest manuscript (the Sinaitic) is reckoned to have been written about three centuries after the death of Christ.\nThose of earlier date were either destroyed in the persecutions under which the church suffered, or were worn out by use. These oldest manuscripts are preserved with great care in the Museums and Libraries of Europe. During the Middle Ages, when ignorance and corruption prevailed and the Bible was hidden in monasteries away from the people, God was still carrying on his work, preserving the Scriptures from destruction even in the midst of Satan\u2019s stronghold, the apostate [R1146] Church of Rome. A favorite occupation of the monks during the Middle Ages was the copying of the manuscripts of the N.T. \u2026 Of these manuscripts there are said to be now more than two thousand, of various dates from the fourth to the fifteenth centuries. The quiet seclusion of those monks gave them special opportunities for careful copying, and years were sometimes spent in the copying of a single manuscript.\nVery early in the Christian Era translations of the New Testament Scriptures were made into several languages, and the different factions that early developed and continued to exist, though they might have been desirous of adding to or taking from the original text in order to give their claims a show of Scriptural support, were watched by each other to see that they did not do so, and had they succeeded in corrupting the text in one language, another translation would make it manifest.\nEven the Douay translation, in use in the Romish church, is in most respects substantially the same as the King James translation. The fact that during the \u201cdark ages\u201d the Scriptures were practically cast aside, being supplanted by the decrees of popes and councils, so that its teachings had no influence upon the masses of the people who did not have copies in their possession\u2014nor could they have read them if they had them\u2014doubtless made unnecessary the serious alteration of the text, at a time when bold, bad men had abundant power to do so. For men who would plot treason, incite to wars and commit murders for the advancement of the papal hierarchy, as we know was done, would have been bold enough for anything. Thus the depth of ignorance in the dark ages served to protect and keep pure God\u2019s Word, so that its clear light has shone specially at the two ends of the Gospel age. (1 Cor. 10:11.) The few interpolations which were dared, in support of the false claims of Papacy, were made just as the gloom of the \u201cdark ages\u201d was closing in upon mankind, and are now made glaringly manifest, from their lack of harmony with the context, their antagonism with other scriptures and from their absence in the oldest and most complete and reliable manuscripts.\nAs to the relative values of ancient manuscripts, we quote the following comments from the pen of that eminent German scholar, Constantine Tischendorf, who spent many years of his life in diligently searching out and comparing the various ancient manuscripts and translations of the Scriptures in many languages, and who has furnished to the church the results of his investigation in a careful exhibit of the various departures of the English Authorized Version of the New Testament from the three oldest and most important manuscripts.\n\u201cAs early as the reign of Elizabeth the English nation possessed an authorized translation, executed by the Bishops under the guidance of Archbishop Parker; and this, half a century later, in the year 1611, was revised at the command of James the First by a body of learned divines, and became the present \u2018Authorized Version.\u2019 Founded as it was on the Greek text at that time accepted by Protestant theologians, and translated with scholarship and conscientious care, this version of the New Testament has deservedly become an object of great reverence, and a truly national treasure to the English Church. The German Church alone possesses in Luther\u2019s New Testament a treasure of similar value\u2026.\n\u201cThe Authorized Version, like Luther\u2019s, was made from a Greek text which Erasmus in 1516, and Robert Stephens in 1550, had formed from manuscripts of later date than the tenth century. Whether those manuscripts were thoroughly trustworthy\u2014in other words, whether they exhibited the Apostolic original as perfectly as possible\u2014has long been matter of diligent and learned investigation. Since the sixteenth century Greek manuscripts have been discovered of far greater antiquity than those of Erasmus and Stephens; as well as others in Latin, Syriac, Coptic, and Gothic, into which languages the sacred text was translated between the second and fourth centuries; while in the works of the Fathers, from the second century downwards, many quotations from the New Testament have been found and compared\u2026.One thing is agreed upon by the majority of those who understand the subject, namely, that the oldest copies approach the original text more nearly than the later ones.\n\u201cProvidence has ordained for the New Testament more sources of the greatest antiquity than are possessed by all the old Greek literature put together. And of these, two manuscripts have for long been especially esteemed by Christian scholars, since, in addition to their great antiquity, they contain very nearly the whole of both the Old and New Testaments. Of these two, one is deposited in the Vatican, and the other in the British Museum. Within the last ten years a third has been added to the number, which was found at Mount Sinai, and is now at St. Petersburg. These three manuscripts undoubtedly stand at the head of all the ancient copies of the New Testament, and it is by their standard that both the early editions of the Greek text and the modern versions are to be compared and corrected.\n\u201cThe effect of comparing the common English text with the most ancient authorities will be as often to disclose agreement as disagreement. True, the three great manuscripts alluded to differ from each other both in age and authority, and no one of them can be said to stand so high that its sole verdict is sufficient to silence all contradiction. But to treat such ancient authorities with neglect would be either unwarrantable arrogance or culpable negligence; and it would be indeed a misunderstanding of the dealings of Providence, if after these documents had [R1147] been preserved through all the dangers of fourteen or fifteen centuries, and delivered safe into our hands, we were not to receive them with thankfulness as the most valuable instruments for the elucidation of truth.\n\u201c\u2026 To us the most reverential course appears to be, to accept nothing as the Word of God which is not proved to be so by the evidence of the oldest, and therefore most certain, witnesses that he has put into our hands. With this in view, and with this intention, the writer has occupied himself for thirty years past, in searching not only the Libraries of Europe, but the obscurest convents of the East, both in Africa and Asia, for the most ancient manuscript, of the Bible; and has done all in his power to collect the most important of such documents, to arrange them and to publish them for the benefit both of the present age and of posterity, so as to settle the original text of the sacred writers on the basis of the most careful investigation.\n\u201cThe first of these great manuscripts already referred to which came into possession of Europe was the Vatican Codex. Whence it was acquired by the Vatican Library is not known; but it appears in the first catalogue of that collection which dates from the year 1475. The manuscript embraces both the Old and New Testaments. Of the later it contains the four Gospels, the Acts, the seven Catholic Epistles, nine of the Pauline Epistles, and the Epistle to the Hebrews as far as 9:14, from which verse to the end of the New Testament it is deficient; so that not only the last chapters of Hebrews, but the Epistle to Timothy, Titus and Philemon, as well as the Revelation, are missing. The peculiarities of the writing, the arrangement of the manuscript, and the character of the text\u2014especially certain very remarkable readings\u2014all combine to place the execution of the Codex in the fourth century, possibly about the middle of it.\n\u201cThe Alexandrine Codex was presented to King Charles the First in 1628 by Cyril Lucar, Patriarch of Constantinople, who had himself brought it from Alexandria, of which place he was formerly Patriarch, and whence it derives its name. It contains both the Old and New Testaments. Of the New the following passages are wanting:\u2014Matt. 1:1 to 25:6; John 6:50 to 8:52; 2 Cor. 4:13 to 12:6. \u2026It would appear to have been written about the middle of the fifth century.\n\u201cThe Sinaitic Codex I was myself so happy as to discover in 1844 and 1859, at the convent of St. Catherine, on Mount Sinai, in the later of which years I brought it to Russia to the Emperor Alexander the Second, at whose instance my second journey to the East was undertaken. It contains both Old and New Testaments\u2014the latter perfect without the loss of a single leaf\u2026.All the considerations which tend to fix the date of manuscripts lead to the conclusion that the Sinaitic Codex belongs to the middle of the fourth century. Indeed, the evidence is clearer in this case than in that of the Vatican Codex; and it is not improbable (which cannot be the case with the Vatican MS.) that it is one of the fifty copies which the Emperor Constantine in the year 331 directed to be made for Byzantium, under the care of Eusebius of Caesarea. In this case it is a natural inference that it was sent from Byzantium to the monks of St. Catherine by the Emperor Justinian, the founder of the convent. The entire Codex was published by its discoverer, under the orders of the Emperor of Russia, in 1862, with the most scrupulous exactness, and in a truly magnificent shape, and the New Testament portion was issued in a portable form in 1863 and 1865.\n\u201cThese considerations seem to show that the first place among the three great manuscripts, both for age and extent, is held by the Sinaitic Codex, the second by the Vatican, and the third by the Alexandrine. And this order is completely confirmed by the text they exhibit, which is not merely that which was accepted in the East at the time they were copied; but, having been written by Alexandrine copyists who knew but little of Greek, and therefore had no temptation to make alterations, they remain in a high degree faithful to the text which was accepted through a large portion of Christendom in the third and second centuries. The proof of this is their agreement with the most ancient translations\u2014namely, the so-called Italic, made in the second century in proconsular Africa; the Syriac Gospels of the same date, now transferred from the convents of the Nitrian desert to the British Museum; and the Coptic version of the third century. It is confirmed also by their agreement with the oldest of the Fathers, such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement and Origen.\nSt. Catherine\u2019s Monastry, Mount Sinai \u2013 Here Constantine Tischendorf discovered the Sinaitic Codex (one of the original New and Old Testament manuscripts) in 1844 and 1859.\n\u201cThese remarks apply to the Sinaitic Codex\u2014which is remarkably close in its agreement to the \u2018Italic\u2019 version\u2014more than they do to the Vatican MS., and still more so than the Alexandrine, which, however, is of far more value in the Acts, Epistles and Apocalypse than it is in the Gospels [R1147]\u2026.\nAnother remarkable means for preserving and verifying the New Testament writings is their copious quotation in other writings. Origen \u2014 who wrote in the early part of the third century, quotes 5745 passages from all the books in the New Testament; Tertullian \u2014 (A.D. 200), makes more than 3000 quotations from the N.T. books; Clement \u2014 (A.D. 194), quotes 380 passages; Irenaeus \u2014 (A.D. 178), quotes 767 passages; Polycarp \u2014 who was martyred A.D. 165, after serving Christ 86 years, quoted 36 passages in a single epistle; Justin Martyr \u2014 (A.D. 140), also quotes from the N.T. These were all Christian writers; and in addition to these, the Scriptures were largely quoted by heathen and infidel writers, among them Celsus (A.D. 150) and Porphyry (A.D. 304).\nIndeed the entire New Testament, with the exception of about a dozen verses, has been found scattered as quotations through various writings that are still extant. And if every copy of the N.T. had been destroyed by its enemies, the book could have been reproduced from these quotations contained in the writings of the early Christians and their enemies.\nWhile the means for the preservation of the Scriptures have been thus remarkably complete, and in view of the unparalleled opposition with which they have met give evidence of Divine care in their preservation, the means for their verification, and for arriving at an understanding of them in God\u2019s due time, are found to be none the less remarkable. No other book in the world has ever had such attention as this book. The labor that has been spent in the preparation of complete concordances, indexes, various translations, etc., has been enormous; and the results to students of the Bible are of incalculable value. And while we recognize the providence of God in all this, we should and do appreciate these labors of his children and their great service to us, though we utterly repudiate, as useless, the labor that has been spent on many so-called theological writings, which are nothing more than miserable efforts to support the vain traditions of men, the accumulated monstrous volumes of which would indeed form a monument of human folly.\nJust in \u201cThe Time of the End,\u201d when the prophet (Dan. 12:9,10) declares that \u201cthe wise (the meek and faithful children of God) shall understand,\u201d we find these wonderful aids coming forward to our assistance. And parallel with these has happened the general spread of intelligence and education and the placing of the Bible in the hands of the people, thus enabling them to use the helps provided.\nThe Bible claims to be a book written under divine inspiration. The word inspire signifies to breathe in, to infuse, to fill, to inhale\u2014as to inspire the lungs with air. (See Webster\u2019s Dictionary.) Hence, when it is said that certain scriptures, or writings of godly men, were given by inspiration of God (2 Tim. 3:16), it signifies that those men were in some way, whether through miraculous or natural means, inspired by, or brought under the influence of God; so as to be used by him in speaking or writing such words as he wished to have expressed. The prophets and apostles all claimed such inspiration. Peter says, \u201cThe prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Spirit.\u201d\u20142 Pet. 1:21.\nThrough Moses we have the law of God and the only existing credible history of mankind from the creation of Adam down to his own time, covering a period of about 2500 years. While Moses and the other Bible writers were holy men, inspired with pure motives and holy zeal, and while personal pride, ambition, etc., were no part of their spirit, we learn that Moses was inspired with the knowledge of God\u2019s law, both in its great principles and also in the minutiae of its typical ceremonials, by direct revelation from God at Mount Sinai, and of some points of duty at the burning bush at Horeb, etc.\nAs for his historical writings, Moses was evidently guided of God in the collation and presentation in its present complete and connected form of the history of the world down to his day, which was really in great part the history of his own family back to Adam with an account of the creation doubtless given by God to Adam while he was yet in fellowship in Eden. Nor does a correct handing down of family information, covering a period of over 2300 years, seem impossible, or liable, as it would now be, to have become polluted; for, aside from the fact that it was handed down through the God-fearing family line of Seth, it should be remembered that at that time the bodies, brains and memories of men were not so weak as they are now, and as they have been since the flood; and finally, because the long lives of two men link Adam with the family of Abraham, the family of covenant favor,\u2014with Isaac, the typical seed of promise. These two men were Methuselah and Shem. Methuselah was over 200 years old when Adam died, and had abundant opportunity, therefore, for information at first hands; and Shem, the son of Noah, lived contemporaneously with Methuselah for 98 years, and with Isaac for 50 years. Thus, these two living, God-fearing men acted as God\u2019s historians to communicate his revelations and dealings to the family in whom centered the promises, of which Moses was one of the prospective heirs.\nIn addition to these facts, we have the statement of Josephus that Methuselah, Noah and Shem, the year before the flood, inscribed the history and discoveries of the world on two monuments of stone and brick which were still standing in Moses\u2019 time.\nThe Apostle Peter tells us that the prophets of old time often did not understand their own utterances, as they themselves also acknowledge (1 Pet. 1:12; Dan. 12:4,8-10); and we should remember that the twelve apostles (Paul taking the place of Judas\u2014Gal. 1:17; 1 Tim. 2:7) not only filled the office of apostles\u2026 they also, especially Peter and Paul and John, filled the office of prophets, and were not only given the spirit of wisdom and understanding by which they were enabled to understand and explain the previously dark prophecies, but in addition to this we believe that they were under the guidance and supervision of the Lord to such an extent that their references to things future from their day, things therefore not then due to be fully understood, were guided, so as to be true to an extent far beyond their comprehension, and such consequently were as really prophetic as the utterances of the old-time prophets. Illustrations of this are to be found in the Revelations of the Apostle John, in Peter\u2019s symbolic description of the Day of the Lord (2 Pet. 3:10-13), and in numerous references to the same period by Paul also, among which were some things hard to be understood even by Peter (2 Pet. 3:16) and only partially then by Paul himself. The latter, however, was permitted to see future things more clearly than others of his time, and to that end he was given special visions and revelations which he was not allowed to make known to others (2 Cor. 12:1-4), but which, nevertheless, influenced and colored his subsequent teachings and his epistles. And these very items which Peter thought strange of, and called \u201chard to be understood,\u201d are the very items which now, in God\u2019s due time, for which they were intended, so grandly illuminate not only Peter\u2019s prophecies and John\u2019s Revelation, but the entire word and plan of God,\u2014that the man of God may be thoroughly furnished.\u20142 Tim. 3:16,17.\n\u2026 There were, even in the days of the apostles, ambitious men who taught another gospel and claimed for themselves the honors of special revelations and authority as apostles and teachers of no less authority than the twelve apostles. And ambitious men of the same sort have from time to time since arisen\u2014Emanuel Swedenborg and many less able and less notable\u2014whose claims, if conceded, would not only place them in rank far above Paul, the prince of the apostles, but whose teachings would tend to discredit entirely, as \u201cold wives\u2019 fables,\u201d the whole story of redemption and remission of sins through the blood of the cross. These would-be apostles, boastful, heady, high-minded, have \u201canother gospel,\u201d a perversion of the gospel of Christ; and above all they despise and seek to cast discredit upon the words of Paul who so clearly, forcibly and logically lifts up the standard of faith and points to the cross\u2014the ransom\u2014as the sure foundation, and who so clearly showed that pseudo -apostles, false apostles, would arise and deceive many.\nIt not only required an inspiration to write God\u2019s plan, but it also requires an inspiration of the Almighty to give an understanding of that revelation; yet this inspiration is of a different sort.\nWhen any one has realized himself a sinner, weak, imperfect and condemned, and has accepted of Christ as his Redeemer, and full of love and appreciation has consecrated his heart (his mind, his will) to the Lord, to henceforth please not himself but his Redeemer,\u2014God has arranged that such a consecration of the natural mind brings a new mind.\nThe spirit of the truth inspires and controls to a greater or lesser extent \u2026 their words and thoughts, and even their very looks.\nYet such an inspiration, common to all the saints, in proportion to their development, should be critically distinguished from the special and peculiarly guided and guarded inspiration of the twelve apostles, whom God specially appointed to be the teachers of the church, and who have no successors in this office. Only twelve were \u201cchosen,\u201d and when one of these, Judas, fell from his honorable office, the Lord in due time appointed Paul to the place; and he not only has never recognized others, but clearly indicates that he never will recognize others in that office.\u2014Rev. 21:14.\nWith the death of the Apostles the canon of Scripture closed, because God had there given a full and complete revelation of his plan for man\u2019s salvation; though some of it was in a condensed form which has since expanded and is expanding and unfolding and will continue to expand and shine more and more until the perfect day\u2014the Millennial Day\u2014has been fully ushered in. Paul expresses this thought clearly when he declares that the Holy Scriptures are able to make wise unto salvation, and that they are sufficient.\nAs we consider, then, the completeness, harmony, purity and grandeur of the Bible, its age and wonderful preservation through the wreck and storms of [nearly] six thousand years, it must be admitted to be a most wonderful book; and those who have learned to read it understandingly, who see in it the great plan of the ages, cannot doubt that God was its inspiring Author, as well as its Preserver. Its only parallel is the book of nature by the same great Author.\nPosted on July 31, 2018 August 24, 2018 by Bible Students DailyPosted in Hymns of DawnTagged 1 Chron. 27\"32, 1 Kings 14:21, 1 Kings 18, 1 Sam. 10:25, 100 ad, 100ad, 1475, 1611, 1628, 1844, 1859, 2 Chron. 33, 2 Cor. 12:6, 2 Cor. 4:13, 2 tim, 2 Tim. 3:15, 2043, 331ad, a beautiful temple, accept Christ, Adam, alexandrian, Aramaic, Authorized version, Bible, bible authenticity, bible credibility, bible translations, blessed bible, Br.

Education is just that important! More education, more Camaros.\nDo you think I\u2019m cynical? Do you think I consider my countrymen to be that crass and \u2014 heaven forfend \u2014 stupid?\nWell, yes I am. And yes, yes I do.\nI\u2019ve based my conclusions on a lifetime of observations of what Americans truly value. It isn\u2019t education, really. We don\u2019t care what kind of low-brow, thick-fingered troglodyte dullard you resemble as long as you have good credit and faithfully participate in consumerism. A college education has traditionally been the best path to full citizenship, where you extract the maximum compensation from a corporation in order to pay for dumb stuff that\u2019s supposed to make you happy and obviously better than others.\nSo really, I support free college for everyone. I\u2019d like college degrees to be so common that they no longer represent any potential income advantage at all. I\u2019d like to see the market flooded with not only liberal-arts majors, but also engineers, doctors, scientists \u2014 everything. At that point, we\u2019ll all be living with mom until we\u2019re 40 while working at Starbucks, and this whole spurious correlation of degree with income will be a distant memory. We\u2019ll get to study whatever we want, and to get back to actually valuing education over GM\u2019s answer to the Ford Mustang.\nYou with me on this? I hope so.\nAnyway, when politicians on stage talk about making college more available or even free, some people in their audiences get excited. The people who get excited are people who haven\u2019t yet gone to college, or parents of people who haven\u2019t yet gone. Then, there are those who get resentful. These are the people still making college loan payments.\nIn the minds of the people who get excited there floats one specific image. It\u2019s not an image of long nights spent inhaling the wisdom buried in books, nor hunched over a laptop writing the one research paper to end all research papers. It\u2019s not an image of long conversations on campus with other seekers, when all come to some new mutual understanding of a truth revealed. It\u2019s not an image of a lifetime spent as an enlightened citizen armed with the knowledge and cognitive tools to make good choices in one\u2019s community and to truly participate in democracy.\nNo. The image is of a yellow Camaro. With stripes. Just like Bumblebee from Transformers.\nSo perhaps it\u2019s only just that college not be free after all. It\u2019s not really about education, see. It\u2019s more like a business. Put in your 4-6 years and your $100K-$250K and if you\u2019ve played your cards right, you have income for life. But the only way this can work is if there is some entrance fee. Gotta keep it exclusive in some way. There aren\u2019t enough Camaros to go around.","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/billlabrie.com\/free-college-not-so-fast\/"}

The theory is that ordinarily, radicals at the back of the birds\u2019 eye respond to Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The magnetic field will cause the electron to leave its spot in the chemical compass and start a chain of reactions to produce a particular chemical.\nAs long as the birds keep pointing the same direction, more the chemical will build up. Exactly how are our noses capable of distinguishing and identifying a myriad road of different shaped molecules. According to Turin\u2019s Quantum theory of olfaction, when a smelly molecule enters the nose and bind to a receptor, it allows a process called quantum tunnelling to happen in the receptor. Quantum tunnelling , an electron can pass through a material to jump from point A Point B in a way that seeing to bypass the intervening space.\nAs with the bird\u2019s quantum compass, the crucial factor is resonance. A particular bond in the small molecule can resorts with the right energy to help an electron on one side of the receptor molecule leap to the other side. The electron can only make this leap through the so called quantum tunnel if the bond is vibrating with just the right energy.\nWhen the electron leaps to the other site on the receptor, it could trigger a chain reaction that ends up signals to the brain that the receptor has come into contact with that particular molecule.

The space and time are in the cosmic plane where the cosmic vectors are acting on the virtual particle responsible for the universal expansion. The curled up vectors on the virtual particle is zero.\nThe change of the cosmic coordinate determines the physical property of mass field conversion. And it makes particle and antiparticles. The particles and the antiparticles are the components of the life flux. Life flux supposed to be in different bound state of the one fundamental field. Heisenberg unified field equation is applicable for life flux.\nSuppose virtual particles are omnipresent in the cosmos they might be infinite velocity and below the absolute zero temperature. The universe that might have been expanding from an elementary virtual particle filled with particles and antiparticles. These are varying in velocities. Strings also model it. Jamming of particles and antiparticles gives binary code for the soul. These particles have absolute past, absolute present and absolute future. The singularity of the soul and the perception of the cosmic life can be explained if we can demonstrate virtual particles below the absolute zero temperature. The understanding of curled physical parameters of particles and antiparticles is the perception of cosmic life.\nLife flux has the infinite closed curve property. The parallel transport in the life flux vectors makes the consciousness. Consciousness is a curvature tensor. It has the property that if it vanish in one system of coordinate it will vanish in every system of coordinate. Life flux consists of particles and antiparticles code the soul. It consists of photon chronon complex from the mass field conversion. The field line of life flux may be called as life line. The determination of life line is by the gravians and other extreme physical forces.\nEmily, L., Que, Reiner Bleher, Francesca, E. Duncan Betty ,Y. Kong, Seth A.

The organization created and operated a sophisticated online infrastructure that allowed hackers to obtain and conceal stolen money, primarily from U.S. companies\u2019 bank accounts, and transfer it to countries outside the United States. The organization created seemingly legitimate websites for fake companies, then sent spam emails advertising employment opportunities.

The organization falsely represented that the individual\u2019s job was to receive payments from businesses into their personal bank accounts, withdraw the money, then wire the funds to the company\u2019s partners overseas.

{"text":"Though it's typically the faces in front of the camera that fans associate with a hit TV series, many of your favorite shows had some very famous people behind the scenes as well. From \"Star Trek\" to \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" legendary Emmy, Grammy and even Oscar winners helped create the shows that have become integral parts of TV history.\nThe tradition of big names producing signature shows continues this season with Rebel Wilson's \"Super Fun Night\" on ABC. Wilson is producing her American TV debut along with comedian Jeff Ross and Conan O'Brien and his Conaco Productions, who was behind \"Andy Barker, P.I.\" and the short-lived NBC drama \"Outlaw,\" starring Jimmy Smits.\nO'Brien also co-created \"Super Fun Night\" with Wilson and had only the highest praises for her at the Television Critics Association Summer 2013 press tour earlier this month, comparing Wilson's character Kimmie to Lucille Ball and Tina Fey's iconic characters.\nWith Desilu Productions, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's production company that brought \"I Love Lucy\" to life, Lucille Ball threw her weight behind some classic shows, including \"Star Trek.\" At the time it was acquired by Gulf & Western, which had just gotten hold of Paramount Pictures, Desilu was producing \"Star Trek,\" \"Mission: Impossible,\" \"Mannix\" and \"The Lucy Show.\" As the Hollywood story goes, Ball was an early supporter of Gene Roddenberry and her clout helped convince NBC to order a second pilot.\nBall's daughter Lucie Arnaz helped induct \"Star Trek\" star William Shatner into the Television Hall of Fame and recounted her mother's struggles to keep \"Star Trek\" on the air. Arnaz reportedly said Ball's studio chiefs informed her mother, \"'[T]he two most expensive shows are \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Star Trek,\" [so] they have to go.' She used to always listen to everything the dyed-print suits said. But she said, 'No, I like 'em!' And they said, 'They cost too much!' And she said, 'But I like 'em!' So they left them.\"\nDolly Parton\/\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"\nDolly Parton is tangentially responsible for bringing \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" to the small screen. Yes, that Dolly Parton. The singer is the co-owner of Sandollar Productions with Sandy Gallin. According to Spinoff Online, \"Buffy\" caught the eye of Sandollar exec Gail Berman in 1991 before the film came out. After the film's release and subsequent bombing, Berman was inspired by the success of \"Clueless\" the TV show to look into reviving \"Buffy\" for the small screen. Berman and Gallin were listed as executive producers on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" but Parton was not. The rest is history.\nFollowing the success of \"Frasier,\" Kelsey Grammer formed his own production company titled Grammnet Productions. The company has been behind some of Grammer's latest projects including \"Hank\" and \"Boss,\" but also brought \"Girlfriends\" and \"The Game\" to TV. \"Medium,\" starring Patricia Arquette as Allison DuBois, was also a Grammnet production. Grammer's ex-wife and former \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" star Camille Grammer is a good friend of the real-life Allison DuBois, upon whom the show is based. She infamously appeared with Camille on the Bravo hit, taking part in what has become known as \"the dinner party from hell.\"\nGeorge Lopez's long-running self-titled ABC sitcom had a surprising backer: Sandra Bullock. Bullock's Fortis Films company produced the series and cashed in with a syndication deal. The Oscar-winning actress even appeared on the sitcom on three occasions.\n\"If it wasn't for her involvement in me, or her belief in me, I would have had a very different last 10 years,\" Lopez told People in 2011. \"She invested in me, and she wouldn't take no for an answer. And with that, and just who she is, she has my undying love, and my undying loyalty. Every day I thank her for believing in me.\"\nDavid Letterman's Worldwide Pants Incorporated is probably best known for \"The Late Show With David Letterman,\" but it was also behind \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" on CBS. In addition to \"Raymond,\" Worldwide also brought the short-lived \"Bonnie Hunt Show\" to life and NBC's \"Ed,\" starring Tom Cavanagh and Julie Bowen.\nOn paper, a teenage girl and a middle-aged man should be a recipe for creepiness, but thanks to the stuffy charm of Anthony Stewart Head, pretty much every Buffy fan wanted his or her own encyclopedic British mentor. Whether he was cleaning his glasses in a disapproving fashion, lamenting technology or playing the most hilarious drunkard ever, we all know that Buffy would've been nothing without her loyal Watcher.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.huffpost.com\/entry\/lucille-ball-star-trek-surprising-celebrity-producers_n_3756120"}

This is how I did it: - Window symbol was put (in the window class) and gave it my desired width\/height specs. - I gave it a exterior trim roughly the width of a brick (3.67\u201d); made it very thin (1\/16\u201d); and turned off trim under the window. - I assigned a brick bond texture (with a brick bond hatch) to the exterior window trim class. So far this gives you a window with brick side stacks and trim above the window that will soon be covered up by another piece. - Then I duplicated the window in place; turned it into a cased opening; made the jambs, trims and sashes all 0\u201d; - I turned on the \u201clintel\u201d and gave it an 8\u201d ht. ( the ht. of a soldier); and an 1\/8\u201d ext. protrusion (so it sticks out proud of the top window trim). - I assigned a brick bond texture (with hatch) that runs vertically... to the \"lintel\" class. - I turned on the \u201csill\u201d and fooled with the specs till I had it where I wanted it. - I assigned a brick bond texture (with hatch) that runs vertically (it might be the horizontal brick bond that works) to the \"sill\" class. - I also increased the width of this duplicate window symbol (wide enough for the lintel above and sill below to line up with the edge of the window trim on the main window symbol). - I may have fooled with the ht. slightly so that lintels and sills all aligned properly with the ht. of the main window symbol. - I changed the class on this duplicated window symbol to \u201cnon-plot\u201d so that it would not show up on the window schedule - Lastly, I extruded a keystone shape (these vary in size)\u2026I made mine a little taller than the soldiers\u2026and slid it into place.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/forum.vectorworks.net\/index.php?\/tags\/keystones\/"}
{"text":"Most of us crochet for others, making things as gifts and requests and all the snuggly things to keep our families warm. I love gifting crochet baby booties. They\u2019re quick to make and even a simple pattern can be used in so many ways. They also just make a nice little addition to a gift set. I used a simple pattern to make these crochet baby booties and although the pink and cream are perfect for Valentine\u2019s Day and baby girls, you can easily change up the colors to make these for baby boys too.\nThese sweetheart booties are made for babies 0-3 months old. They can be made in one piece using just one color if you like, or you can try out different combinations for the sole and the top of the booties. The little bow on the front of these booties is just a spare length of matching yarn that I tied around the stitch post, but you can customize these any way you like. Or, you could even add little crochet roses or a pretty button to finish them off.\nRound 1: With the pink yarn, chain 11. Starting in the second space from the hook, HDC 9. Work 5 HDC into the next space. Next, you\u2019ll be working through the loops on the other side of the foundation chain. HDC 8, then work 2 HDC into the last space. Place a marker to mark the beginning of the round (24 stitches).\nRound 2: Work 2 HDC into the next space, HDC 9, 2 HDC into each of the next 5 spaces, then HDC 9 to the end of the round (30).\nRound 3: Ch 1, HDC into the same space. HDC in each space around (31).\nRound 4: Switch to cream yarn and SC through the back loops only (31), then slip stitch to the first space.\nRound 6: SC 12, * HDC decrease once, then HDC into the next* 3 times, SC 11 to the end of the round (28).\nRound 7: SC 12, then DC decrease 3 times, SC 11 (25).\nRound 8: Slip stitch all the way around, and then bind off. Then, weave in the tail ends of the yarn and trim the excess yarn.\nLastly, I took 4 inches of the same pink as the sole of these crochet baby booties and just tied it around the two stitches at the front of the toe. I tied it into a little bow and used a drop of hot glue to secure the knot in place and make sure it wouldn\u2019t open. Then, I trimmed the tails of the bow so they were even.\nThanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed this pattern!

{"text":"It has been a while since I have posted really something from our kitchen and it is already July. New month has started and with new month, our Mexican family has left back to Mexico. We are back to normal and alone\u2026 which brings lot of mixed emotions. However, their leaving was very sad and to be honest, we already miss them. And the fact that we are not going to see each other any time soon. Probably next year\u2026 which sounds even worst when I see it now.\nWhile was our family with us, I did not cook that much, to be honest. Most of the time, we enjoyed proper Mexican cooking and I did just bits afterwards. So, I am going to share with you my bits \u2013 creamy pork liver with rice, and then beef with buk choy and rice (very nice meal at the end as I cook from leftovers).\nThis dish was just mix of everything. We have done lot of BBQ while having Mexican around. However, as well many leftovers as the house is full. So, I have made rice dish with meet mixed with vegetables which I found in my fridge.\nOnce you have your leftovers ready and fridge cleaned, you can take a big pan and add vegetable oil. Cut beef into slices and them into the pan. In the mean time, cut mushrooms and chorizo into smaller pieces and add them to the meat. Fry everything for couple of minutes (until are mushrooms done). Add Soy sauce into the pan and cook everything for 10 \u2013 15 minutes (as the meat is ready. If you have fresh meat, cook until it is done). Wash buk choy in the mean time (I am big fan of this vegetable), slice it and add into the pan and fry it additional 10 minutes. Then you can just season it according to your taste and warm up rice from previous day. With this dish I have gotten rid of many leftovers in my fridge and had a delicious dinner. You can serve it with freshly cut radish sprinkled with Feta cheese.\nOne pot dish again. I am simply huge fan of it. Easy, quick and possible to feed lot of hungry stomachs \ud83d\ude42 This time, I have chosen really something simple\u2026 chicken rice casserole with baby spinach leaves and mushrooms which was done in 30 minutes.\nFirstly, peel the potato and cut it into thin slices. Take two pans and add olive oil into one of the. Fry slices of potatoes, drain them and put them aside. Afterwards, cut tomatoes into slices, fry them in the same pan as potato and when done, put aside as well.\nTake pieces of pork shoulder and the second pan with olive oil and fry it until done. If you wish, you can season the pork meat however you prefer. When done, put the meat aside. Cut bacon into small pieces and fry it in the same pan as pork meat. Remove again and put aside. At the end, fry sausages in the same pan and when done, put them aside as well. Start with preheating the oven to 200 degrees.\nAdd saffron to the pan together with crushed tomato sauce, add chickpeas and rice. Add crushed garlic. Mix everything together and fry it for couple of minutes. Take a big pan \/ clay pot suitable for oven, add rice mix into the pan, followed by meat, sausages, potatoes and tomato slices. Place the head of garlic in the middle and at the end, pour the broth (or any of chosen stocks with hot water) and put the pan \/ clay pot in the oven for 20 minutes or until is the rice soft.\nServe! \ud83d\ude42 If you wish, you can season it with salt and as we did \u2013 with avocado and tortilla aside!\nHow are you? I have been lately quite busy and barely looked at my blog and have a time read yours. However, I have found finally time and enjoying moment when I am not needed \ud83d\ude42 And I really appreciate those moments, as there is not many of them \ud83d\ude42 So\u2026 what about today? Breakfast! How does your breakfast look like? Mine \u2013 taquitos with meat. Quite unusual breakfast for me. I would mainly grab taco as a snack, lunch or dinner. But\u2026 here in Mexico, pretty often thing! \ud83d\ude42 So\u2026 let me introduce our breakfast tacos \u2013 tinga, barbacoa, de res and buche.\nBeef. Beef prepared in slow cooker, tender and juicy, served with corn tortillas. Is there something better? \ud83d\ude1b Probably yes, however this has been really high on my \u201cfavourite list\u201d. My husband loves it with salsa verde, lime, onion and coriander. Hopefully, you will love it as we do!\nI would say\u2026 One of the most common type of tacos! It is originated from Puebla in Mexico and made from shredded chicken in tamato sauce, chipotle chillies in adobo and sliced onions. If you like a bit of spiciness, give it a go. Look here for really nice and authentic recipe!\nTacos de res are tacos with beef meat, not spicy ones \ud83d\ude42 And of the most popular ones as well. So let\u00b4s have a look what is needed and how to prepare it!\nFirst preheat the oven and blend chipotle and adobo sauce until smooth. Take a meat, cut it into steaks and brush the blended sauce on top of it. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Afterwards, add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until golden but still crunchy. Put into a large heatproof bowl or dish, leaving as much oil as possible in the skillet, and place in the oven to keep warm.Return the frying pan to medium-high heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and heat until shimmering. Add the steak and brown on both sides. When done, slice steaks into small pieces. Mix the onion and slices of meat in the bowl and add the salt. Taste and season with more salt if needed. At the end\u2026 serve with tortillas, finely chopped onion and coriander. If you like spicy tacos, serve with salsa verde \ud83d\ude42 And enjoy!\nSooo\u2026 this was introduction of breakfast taquitos! Have a great night my dear friends!","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/withcoloursandcanitointhekitchen.blog\/tag\/meat\/"}

{"text":"Almaty's largest, though not necessarily its most enjoyable, museum sits a short walk from Republic Square. Head east along Satpaev Street, and then turn right down Furmanov Street at the first crossroads. The museum is housed in a large blue-domed building constructed in the early 1980s, on the east side of Furmanov Street. It is set back from the road amidst gardens. The museum as an institution dates from the 19th century: it was founded in Orenburg, and moved to Almaty in the 1930s.\nMuseum takes you through Kazakhstan's history from Bronze Age burials to telecommunications and the transfer of the capital to Astana, with many beautiful artefacts. It's just a pity that signage in nonlocal languages is limited to 'Don't touch, please!'.\nThe large foyer, beneath the central dome, is enlivened by costumed mannequins depicting various periods in the early history of Kazakhstan, including a model of the Golden Man. There is an uninspiring cafe downstairs, several souvenir shops offering carpets and handicrafts, and frequent temporary exhibits.\nThe permanent exhibits are arranged in four large halls.\nHALL 1, starting downstairs, deals with archaeological finds and early history up to Chinggis Khan (with balbals and models of some of Kazakhstan's major monuments). The exhibits are arranged in an orderly historical progression from fragments of dinosaurs to a model of the Timurid Mausoleum of Khodja Ahmed Yassaui. Among the items encountered along this historical route is a Bronze Age burial in a stone-walled coffin. There is a fascinating bronze sacrificial table from the 4th or 3rd century BC, found in Almaty Oblast, which depicts a procession of lions around the rim, while in the centre wild animals and birds are feasting on a dead deer. There is an interesting display of balbals, standing stones from the Turkic period around the 7th to 9th centuries. A moustachioed man with rather droopy eyes holds up a glass. Another man holds a bird. The exhibition continues upstairs, with displays focusing on the flourishing of urban life from the 10th century. The development of trade along the Silk Routes is illustrated by the presence of a Japanese bowl and engraved Iranian copper dish. A dramatic diorama depicts the Mongols of Genghis Khan storming the city of Otrar. There is an impressive display of items from Saraichik in Atyrau Oblast, including a 14th-century money box, ink pots and a tall bronze lamp. And finally the Mausoleum of Khodja Ahmed Yassaui, represented by pieces of ceramic tile as well as a model of the building.\nNext to hall 1 is the 'Open Collection', an exhibit of outstanding ancient gold adornments found in Kazakhstan, mainly from Scythian burials between the 6th and 3rd centuries BC (you do get a tour in English, Russian or Kazakh for your money).\nHALL 2, located amongst the souvenir shops on the ground floor, focuses on ethnography, featuring a finely kitted-out yurt and some beautifully worked weaponry and horse and camel gear, plus musical instruments and exotic costumes going back to the 18th century.\nThe hall is centred on a yurt, standing in the middle of the hall, replete with colourful rugs on the floor and walls, engraved wooden chests, and a bed with elegantly decorated side panels. Along the walls of the hall run various displays. Hunting techniques are depicted with a mannequin of a falconer.\nThere is a model of a waterwheel, turned by ceramic jugs which would alternately fill and empty. An intriguing display, unfortunately in Kazakh only, sets out to demonstrate the distinct genetic and physiological make-up of the Kazakh people. There is a display of items considered to have protective powers against the evil eye: a black and white-striped rope; the claw of a golden eagle; and the skull of a wolf. There are items used by shamans, such as a kobyz customised with the addition of a mirror and feathers. There are displays too of costumes, jewellery, musical instruments, religious items and children's games.\nHALL 3, on the top floor, is a mix of items on the multi-ethnic character of Kazakhstan and Soviet-period history. The former involves displays of the costumes, artefacts and traditions of many of the ethnic groups which make up modern Kazakhstan, ranging from the several million-strong Russian community to the Assyrians (of whom there are 540 in Kazakhstan, according to the figures presented here). An interesting display on the Korean community was contributed by the Korean State Ethnographic Museum. The rest of the hall commemorates the heroes of Soviet Kazakhstan. There are presentations on various Heroes of Socialist Labour, before you are taken into the war period, with a list of Kazakhstanis earning the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. A diorama depicts a stalwart Red Army defending a wintry line against advancing German tanks.\nHALL 4, on the same floor, focuses on post-independence Kazakhstan. There are displays about the State flag and emblem, currency, awards, hydrocarbons wealth and mineral resources, Kazakhstan's role in space exploration and its sporting successes. President Nazarbaev's books are displayed in various languages. The embroidered cloak used at the presidential inauguration of December 1991 is on display, as is the heavy inauguration belt, complete with dagger. A striking wall carpet depicts the leaders of the central Asian states (Nazarbaev is second from the right), commemorating a meeting of the presidents in Bishkek in 1995.\nOn the other side of Furmanov Street, almost opposite the museum, the white marble-faced square-based building is the Presidential Residence, built by the French construction company Bouygues in 1995.","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/eurasia.travel\/kazakhstan\/cities_towns_places\/southeast_kazakhstan\/almaty\/the_central_state_museum\/"}

{"text":"Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada -Monday, March 27, 2017 - Canada Zinc Metals Corp. (\u201cCanada Zinc Metals\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d, TSX Venture Exchange: CZX) is pleased to provide an update on its 2017 exploration plans for the Akie and Kechika North projects.\nThe Company has engaged Murphy Geological Services to conduct a structural interpretation and analysis of the Company\u2019s high-resolution satellite imagery across several properties including Akie, Yuen North and Mt. Alcock. This work will be initiated in early April and will provide valuable targeting data in advance of this year\u2019s regional and drilling exploration programs. Planning for the Company\u2019s previously announced 2017 exploration program, including up to 7,500 metres of drilling, is currently entering the final detail phase.\nThe Company has engaged Murphy Geological Services of Midleton, Cork, Ireland to conduct a detailed structural interpretation of the Company\u2019s high-resolution satellite imagery across several of its properties including Akie, Mt. Alcock and Yuen North. This work is anticipated to begin in early April with final products to be delivered in advance of the exploration program set to begin in early June.\nIn 2013, the Company acquired 1-metre resolution Pleiades satellite imagery over the Kechika Trough mineral tenures. The imagery has been used extensively for interpretation and planning purposes. This work by Murphy Geological Services will utilize the Pleiades satellite imagery as well as Landsat-7 and Sentinel-2 imagery in order to establish the regional structural framework. The interpretation will identify the presence of all regional scale and other major first-order fault structures as well as characterizing the nature and timing of these structures. This will be followed by a detailed interpretation over the Company\u2019s properties that will identify both second and third-order structures as well as other structurally significant features.\nThis interpretation will be integrated and assessed in conjunction with data from the Company\u2019s extensive digital database which includes topographical datasets, additional imagery datasets, geophysical datasets (including the 2012 and 2013 airborne VTEM survey and the 2015 airborne gravity gradiometry survey), geological datasets and geochemical datasets.\nTop ranked targets will be generated as a result of the interpretation and data synthesis, and specific areas of interest will be assessed during the upcoming exploration program to determine their viability as drill targets. At a future date the Company may expand the scope of this interpretation to include all the property blocks in the Kechika Regional project including Bear\/Spa, Driftpile South and Saint.\nPlanning for the previously announced 2017 exploration program has reached the detail stage with contract tenders prepared and sent out for costing. The plan is to mobilize two drills to the Akie property to complete an extensive and aggressive diamond drill program of up to 7,500 metres for 2017. Approximately 5,000 metres of drilling is planned to target the Cardiac Creek deposit with a focus on expanding the down-dip limits of the high-grade core of the deposit as well as other expansion targets down-dip and along strike. Up to 2,500 metres of drill testing is planned as infill targets across the deposit with the primary purpose of providing additional material for subsequent metallurgical lab testing. The diamond drill program is expected to start early June and continue through to the end of September.\nIn addition to the drilling, the Company is also considering a ground gravity survey over select targets as well as additional geochemical sampling to expand upon open-ended anomalies located on the eastern edge of the property associated with the Sitka Showing. These data, coupled with existing airborne gravity data, airborne VTEM data, structural analysis and a recently revised regional geological base map will be used to prioritize additional drill targets on the Akie property.\nThe Company is the 100% owner of eleven, large, contiguous property blocks that comprise the Akie and Kechika Regional projects. The Company\u2019s flagship Akie Project is host to the Cardiac Creek deposit and remains the primary corporate focus. The Kechika Regional Project includes the Pie, Yuen, Cirque East and Mt. Alcock properties extending northwest from the Akie property for approximately 140 kilometres along strike of the highly prospective Gunsteel Formation shale; the main host rock for known SEDEX zinc-lead-silver deposits in the Kechika Trough of northeastern British Columbia. These projects are located approximately 260 kilometres north northwest of the town of Mackenzie, British Columbia, Canada. The generative portfolio of Kechika Regional properties offer shareholders and interested exploration companies high-potential opportunities for new discoveries in the Kechika Trough.\nThe Pie, Yuen and Cirque East properties are the subject of an option agreement concluded on September 9, 2013 with Teck and its JV partner, Korea Zinc Co., Ltd. (\"Korea Zinc\" KRX:KorZinc 010130). Under the terms of the option agreement, Teck and Korea Zinc can acquire up to a 70% interest in the Pie, Yuen and Cirque East properties for $8.5 million of cumulative exploration expenditures.\nTeck has incurred $3.0 million of exploration expenditures to the end of 2016 on the Pie Option Properties using an integrated approach to exploration to decrease risk and maximize the potential for discovery. In accordance with the Option Agreement Teck and Korea Zinc must spend an additional $0.5 million by the end of 2017 to exercise the \u201cFirst Option\u201d and earn an undivided 51% interest in the Pie Option Properties.\nUpon exercising the First Option, Teck and Korea Zinc would have an additional option (the \"Second Option\") to acquire a further 19% interest in the properties for a total interest of 70%, by incurring an additional $5.0 million in exploration expenditures on or before December 31, 2019.\nThe Company\u2019s flagship Akie property is situated within the Kechika Trough, the southernmost area of the regionally extensive Paleozoic Selwyn Basin, one of the most prolific sedimentary basins in the world for the occurrence of SEDEX zinc-lead-silver and stratiform barite deposits.\nDrilling on the Akie property by Canada Zinc Metals since 2005 has identified a significant body of baritic-zinc-lead-silver SEDEX mineralisation known as the Cardiac Creek deposit. The deposit is hosted by siliceous, carbonaceous, fine grained clastic rocks of the middle to late Devonian Gunsteel Formation.\nThe Company has outlined a NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource at Cardiac Creek, including an indicated resource of 19.6 million tonnes grading 8.2% zinc, 1.6% lead and 13.6 g\/t silver (at a 5% zinc cut-off grade) and an inferred resource of 8.1 million tonnes grading 6.8% zinc, 1.1% lead and 11.2 g\/t silver (at a 5% zinc cut-off grade).","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/zincxresources.com\/news\/index.php?content_id=117"}

{"text":"Actually my previous times are invalid because I had more packages available while right now due to a reboot my built package cache has been cleared.\nSo due to there being less packages, it is definitely much faster. However two seconds is still a bit slow.\nOne thing that could speed up searching ZIP entries would be if the hashcode of the entries were stored. However that would be a bit ugly. What I actually could do is binary sort all of the filenames using the String comparator. This way when searching for an entry it happens at a faster rate. This would reduce the number of searches and would find them faster.\nThat however requires being able to read the filename of the directory entries. So perhaps instead of initializing a new file for every pass of the entry, instead what is done is that there is a getEntryName which returns a string of the given index. That way the entry names can be cached and then used to initialize the entries also. Then with this, searching through entries does not have to initialize all of them, it just has to read their name. So this would reduce the number of allocations and parsing performed since creation of ZipEntry would be avoided.\nSeems I never cached read entries, so they were never placed in the array to be used again, so on every get of an entry they were reinitialized.\nSo this is a definite 1 second faster than before.\nWhen it comes to sorted entries, I suppose it should depend on how many entries are within the ZIP and if a request threshold was reached I suppose. However that would complicate things a bit, it would likely be best to just sort them all at the start. However, if ZIPs are just thrown away then the sorting will not matter at all. So I suppose for the package list that ZIPs should remain open?\nIf the ZIP remains open then a binary search would be better. However in the long run, ZIPs will remain open due to being used as resources. When a ZIP is read into the class path, it will pretty much never close as long as a resource or class will need to be looked up (in general cases, this would be common). So a sorted list by name would definitely be faster when it comes to searching by name.\nAnd now my merge sort works. I just need to now test odd sized elements.\nBig-O wise, binary search beats linear search every time, so I will go for a binary search when a ZIP is initialized.\nI need a way to sort the arrays while also remember their original indices and such. The Comparator and sort operation has to go through all entries, however it passes only a string so the entry order is not known. What I could do instead of strings is sort by hashcode. I would have to handle cases where there are duplicate entries since it is unspecified which index is returned if there are duplicates.\nAlternatively, I could sort a fake list sort of. I can have an array of Integer and then use a Comparator on it. The comparator will read the value and then compare the original strings instead. I could alternatively make a merge sort which takes the index based approach and uses that. Basically instead an array of indexes in their sorted order is used. Then once the values are properly sorted, they are moved back into place from the original depending on the actual index position. So the initial array is just an index from 0 through n. This would require all the strings be created but would not need a number of temporary integers to be created. However, I could not use a built in sorting algorithm. So for simplicity, it will be merge sort.\nAlternatively instead of sorting names, I can just have a sort index of references instead. The name search can just go by these indexes instead of using a linear search.\nI am likely to implement the sorting algorithm many times over especially in the CLDC libraries. Therefor I should have generic code be declared and then use the internal sorting code. Internally the sorting of any type of data can just be done with a single integer array of indexes and a special method. Although there would be a slight speed penalty due to method calls, all of the sorting algorithm code would result in no duplicated sorting algorithms. I really do not have to have 9 merge sort algorithm copies for (all primitives, Object, and Lists). The internal sorting algorithm will create a copy integer array with the input elements, then sort them using a special Comparator.\nI am actually going to have to test the sorting algorithm, so make sure that it works properly.\nActually, the class should have a shorter name.\nI believe I have a merge sort now.\nAnd it fails for a given case.\nSeems for this one merge case, one value is never merged in. It is perhaps the result of a merge of sorts.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/multiphasicapps.net\/uv\/developer-notes\/stephanie-gawroriski\/2016\/06\/18.mkd"}
{"text":"Daily supplements for inflammation? Daily supplements for inflammation?\nDo supplements work? The jury is still out. After several months of confusion and suffering, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. For those of you that don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not really \u201carthritis\u201d. Basically my body is attacking itself. It\u2019s a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease which attacks much more than your joints. It affects, bones, organs, muscles, soft tissues, tendons, ligaments, ect.\nAnyway, the medications they give you to treat this (there is no cure) are pretty scary. So naturally I would rather go the \u201cnatural\u201d route. I\u2019ve done a lot of reading and researching. There are so many people who believe only strong pharmaceutical medications (which include chemo drugs) can help you. But there are many who are trying to help themselves naturally with diet and supplements. I am in the middle. I take both.\nSo, let\u2019s get back to the supplements. What I have found to be somewhat helpful are: Fish oil, turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, Osteo Bi-flex, Calcium\/Mag\/Zinc. Funny thing, I just learned that Osteo Bi-flex has a form of Frankincense in it. This is one of the essential oils that is supposed to be good for many uses, including inflammation! Fish oil (Omega 3) is great for your heart as well. Ginger also helps settle your stomach. Osteo Bi-flex and calcium are supposed to be great for your bones and joint. I take other supplements, but these are the ones that are guided toward helping with inflammation. These supplements will not cure RA or help with the damage, but they can help with some of the inflammation. So, in my opinion, they can\u2019t hurt.\nIf you have regular arthritis or any other inflammatory process going on, you may want to give them a try. I did not list dosages, as this would be a decision that you should make on your own and always, ALWAYS check with you doctor to make sure you can take supplements and they will not interfere with anything else you currently take.\nDisclaimer: This is not intended to be medical advice in any way.

In these fast-paced contexts, windows of opportunity arise \u2014 and close \u2014 quickly.\nTo break the mold of classic university collaborations and address the need for timely recommendations, the University of Minnesota Institute on the Environment and The Nature Conservancy will facilitate onetime workshops between leading economics, finance, conservation and policy experts to tackle specific, decision-driven challenges. The project leads are Jessica Hellmann, director of IonE; Steve Polasky, University economics professor, IonE fellow and co-founder of the Natural Capital Project; and Heather Tallis, lead scientist at The Nature Conservancy.\nThe workshops \u2014 collectively dubbed Wicked Econ Fests \u2014 result in recommendations and the hand-off of advances in economic, finance, policy and conservation thinking to The Nature Conservancy and partners who can drive recommendations to action.\nIonE and TNC will host several workshops each year, providing economically viable guidance on a variety of critical environmental issues, such as how to revive the Gulf of Mexico dead zone and rebuild soils, as outlined in the first Wicked Econ Fest report.\nThanks to the Craig and Susan McCaw Foundation, founding donor of this innovative partnership.","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/environment.umn.edu\/news\/partnership-with-the-nature-conservancy\/"}
{"text":"Created by Giulio Barresi at ECAL (Media and Interaction Design Unit), Connected Tools is a series of objects that explore alternative rituals that could lead to a more reasonable consumption of mobile technologies. Opposite to software solutions (Apple\u2019s iOS 12 update), these hardware devices are designed to create a physical distance between the smartphones and the user.\nThe first tool in the Connected Humans collection is x01 Focus Tool, designed to help users be less distracted by the massive amount of notifications they are receiving daily on their phones. It actively blocks and deletes unnecessary notifications before they even have the time to be displayed. Focus Tool can also be programmed to be less harmful to these distractions depending on how busy the user is. The second tool is x02 Awareness Tool, device that tracks the time spent on the device using a goal for the day. Users can try to spend less time on their screens and beat their friends\u2019 scores. The third and final tool is xO3 Social Tool, designed for restaurants, helps users get more involved in the moment and with the people around them \u2013 plus it charges their phones.\nx02 Awareness Tool runs on ESP32 Dev Module and uses two 12V Stepper Motors driven with two easy Drivers. Also included is a CUI encoder for Stepper motor to monitor the users dragging \u2013 Adafruit Quad Alphanumeric Display as visual Feedback and then a smooth push button to navigate between the different modes \u2013 Old style switch power button, as well as a power state LED. The enclose is made with black 3mm laser cut plexiglass plates covered with 6082 aluminium alloy plates of 1.5mm thickness. The aluminium plates were screwed PZ2 screws in the plexiglass, giving an industrial look. A Swift iOS app was developed to check whenever the user would use his\/her phone. The technique used was to check if the keychain had been unlocked every 10sec. Keychain opens when the phone is unlocked by the user and remains open for 10 seconds. To be able to run the app in the background, location services have to always remain activated, although location is not used at all in the project. This is a limitation of iOS. The app uploads the amount of time spent on the phone to a database. Two values are stored : actual performance, and average performance. The ESP32 connects to the Internet and downloads the actual and average performance. The users can then check the results on the screen have a visual comparison with their goal thanks to the pendents.\nx03 Social Tool runs on ESP32 Dev Module and uses two Adafruit Wireless charging module, two photoresistors to detect charging state of charging module, two LED for user feedback (fading = ready to charge, blinking = phone removed during meal, fade out = phone is now charging). Each unit was separately charged to avoid excessive power noise. Device is made with black 3mm laser cut plexiglass plates covered with 6082 aluminium alloy plates of 1.5mm thickness. Du to the fact that some aluminium plates were CNC cut to provide extra precision between the smallest pieces, the 6082 alloy was needed to ensure a optimal cutting. The ESP32 logs the time the phone is out of the dock during the meal and uploads it to a server. Finally, a thermal printer collects the data and prints a ticket with relative informations about the percentage of time spent on the phone during the meal.\nFor more information about the project, please visit the project page below.\nCredits: Giulio Barresi (project), No\u00e9 Cotter (photography), Alix Chauvet (illustration) with support from Alain Bellet, Cyril Diagne, Christophe Guignard, Gael Hugo (professors at ECAL).","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.creativeapplications.net\/objects\/connected-tools-devices-that-mediate-smartphone-consumption\/"}

{"text":"Today has been nothing short of a horror show. Out of all my trips overseas, this one is an all time travel epic. Waking at five a.m. didn\u2019t seem like a big deal to get to Denver for our ten-thirty flights, but we had stops to make. Starbucks, atms, gas stations, parking, etc\u2026 Organizing in a group always has its kinks. Someone always has something to forget, something lost, and all the other things that just can\u2019t be predicted.\nEverything seemed to be going smoothly; however, that did not last for long. Shortly after checking in with my airline I met up with Whitney and Keith. They had checked in for there first domestic flight and everything was set into motion. The charmed moment didn\u2019t last for long. Once Keith realized that his passport was missing, the day just managed to spiral out of control. While Keith searched his car Whitney and I poked through his carry-on luggage and the airline was pulling his checked luggage off route to his Chicago flight.\nWhile sitting with Whitney, feeling sorry for Keith, I realized that the Baggage check-in lady had given me the wrong gate. I ran to the monitors to see where I should be heading, and saw in bold letters flight cancelled. This set me off in a frenzy to get a hold of another flight, so that I wouldn\u2019t miss my international connections. An hour plus of waiting with four helpful airline clerks and I was set to go. A new route, at a much later time, but still Marseille, France bound. With time to kill I assisted Keith in his quest to find or replace his passport. Despair lingering in the air we pressed on knowing that stagnation wouldn\u2019t resolve the obstacles ahead.\nI combed the car looking intently with hope that the solution would be simple and close at hand. We decided that the many morning stops had to be re-traced and an appointment was set for the next morning at the Denver Passport office. I went to my gate for lunch, knowing that anything could happen and felt reassured that everything would turn out just fine. Keith and I kept in touch over the progress made on project passport. While on the phone with Keith, he checked the last morning stop en-route to the airport, karma favoring him it turned up in the hands of the gas station attendant. The journey could commence! Keith profusely thanked the attendant with new resolve and calmed nerves he returned to the airport to see what his new itinerary would entail.\nColette McInerney and Joe Kinder.\nMany phone calls later everyone involved was at ease and had a new flight plan for the next day. I on the other hand was starting to experience a world of unpredictability. The plane to Chicago was having mechanical delays, an hour later and no word\u2026 The judgment was being postponed for yet another hour, I went to find out how this would effect my international connections. Everyone looked grim. Things were not looking good for me. I was passed from one assistant to the next, until I was put into the hands of Mary. Mary had me set to leave for Chicago with an abundant group of displaced passengers all of whom were more than likely be stuck in the toils of an erratic airport and with only thirteen minutes to connect a flight.\nKnowing that catching that flight would need an act of divine intervention, I protested. I insisted that I not be put blindly into any more madness and that my flights be set in stone. Being a saint Mary managed my options and resolved that the best she could do was get me on a direct flight the following day to London, connecting to Munich and then ultimately to Marseille. I was elated, so I took the option willingly and had Keith pick me up. It was as if the countless hours of journeying had begun but I hadn\u2019t gotten anywhere. The only hang-up was that my luggage was and still is missing. I was told to cross my fingers and hope for the best. The last eighteen hours have been just that. My bags have been found in Chicago, but with no connection through the windy city and still on the ground in Denver nothing can be done except for a courteous claim. What this means, I really don\u2019t know. The best the guy could tell me was that my luggage can puddle jump without me, but when this will happen is now the question. I am starting the trip travel-worn without having traveled with some of the most important pieces of my gear absent; however, there is light at the end of the tunnel since my harness, shoes, and winter jacket are in my carry on. Climbing can commence upon arrival and my life can resume some normalcy.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.climbing.com\/news\/lauren-lee-pro-blog-6\/"}

{"text":"The Centre for Popular Education and Human Rights Ghana (CEPEHRG) is the one and only LGBT led organization working actively in Ghana since the year 1998. The organization strives for equal rights for all persons including LGBT persons in a hostile environment where political, religious and some traditional leaders have threatened to lynch anyone found to be Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual or Trans.\nApart from the numerous religious, social, cultural, and political barriers, CEPEHRG identifies a huge necessity for resources and capacity-building support. Endeavoring to organize around health and rights in a hostile environment without funds, materials and skills creates a situation ripe for burnout.\nComprehensive and systematic capacity-building programs on LGBT issues do not exist for CEPEHRG staff and other actors with interventions for MSM and more.\nFunds from USAID and the Global Fund are channeled towards the mainstream groups thereby making it difficult for LGBT\u2019s to receive such support to improve lives and fund initiatives. For security reasons, community visits by staff and volunteers are mostly done in the evenings and we have to walk back to the stations to board public transport or get a taxi.\nThe little that comes to us to fund our programs does not look holistically at our well-being as but only focuses on condoms and lubricants distribution while other important issues for our community such as human rights and other health services are left in the background. We are concerned by the impact these limitations have on the quality of services, check-ups and follow-ups because of the inadequacy of the very basic services being given to our community. We also need programs that will focus on movement building, entrepreneurial and skill building trainings, since these will give the community the opportunity to be competitive on the job market.\nOur community hopes the future grants for HIV and human rights programs will focus more on the building of capacities of local LGBT organizations to enable them run well-planned and sustainable strategic interventions that will improve the lives of our people and community.\nBuilding LGBT leadership talent has to become an ingrained part and a priority for not just organizations individually, but for the LGBT movement as a whole. CEPEHRG is therefore appealing to grant makers that are supporting LGBT organizations and the broader movement for equality, for funds and other resources to build the capacity of its staff and to carry out the interventions needed to expand our coverage and services to address the needs of the Ghanaian LGBT community.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.amsher.org\/lack-resources-capacity-building-support-towards-realisation-human-rights-lgbt-people-ghana\/"}

It is specifically designed to help the growth of plants.\nThe materials are of high quality. It feels premium when you\u2019re touching them, especially the zippers.

If you\u2019ve got lettuce, herbal cannabis, tomato, pepper, or herbs, this grow tent is what you need. It is specifically designed for the growth of the aforementioned plants and herbs. It features vent holes, is ergonomically designed, and is easy to assemble. Even first time grow tent owners won\u2019t have a hard time in dealing with it.\nIt\u2019s a grow tent that is very easy to set up.

It\u2019s tear resistant.\nSunlight can slightly enter or peep through the zippers.\nThe overall body and frame construction of the grow tent is not that sturdy.\nValuebox Indoor Mylar Hydroponics Grow Tent is another one that we recommend. It\u2019s lightproof, is assured to be durable thanks to its metal bar and connectors, and features its own viewing window.

It\u2019s a sturdy one.\nIt\u2019s a little bit small, and it might not be enough to accommodate all of your plants.\nIts got a weird shape, which might not be a good thing especially if you\u2019re going to place it in a small space.\nThe TopoLite Multiple Size Grow Tent is one of the best product if not the best one in this list. Why? It\u2019s because it boasts itself to have a long lifespan, and that has been proven by us. It\u2019s a great indoor or greenhouse plant home that can help facilitate the proper growth of different species of plants. It has a durable 600D lightproof oxford cloth which has a diameter of 16mm. Its metal rods painted with white coating.

They don\u2019t need a huge area or space to grow properly. This is perfect for people who don't have the luxury of having a huge place or garden to cultivate their plants.\nAnother cool thing about these grow tents is that they help speed up the whole cultivation process. This is what makes them stand out among other gardening methods. The growth process speeds up, some say two-folds or to even three-folds speed. If you want to see fast results, then better get your own grow tent.\nWith the help of a grow tent, you can grow your plants your way. And when we say your way, we mean that you have full control over its development. You can control the variables which affect its growth, as well as the factors that contribute to the changes in its form over time.\nYour plants will undeniably become healthier in the process, because of the sufficient supply of nutrients and minerals they are getting from the highly-secured and effectively-controlled environment.\nThe first thing you should always consider when choosing a grow tent is its size. It's in knowing the size that you can know if you can make the most out of it. Make sure that it can fit the place that you intend to put it on. It should also be capable of supporting the number of plants that you wish to put inside of it.\nThen there's the material which you need to make sure is of high quality. By knowing more about the material of the grow tent, you can assess if the product is durable or if it will last for a long time. The least thing you want to experience is to see your grow tent get easily damaged.\nThe price is another determining factor when it comes to choosing a grow tent. It'd be wise of you if you were to choose a grow tent that is in the midrange of prices. It shouldn't be expensive or neither too cheap. If it's too cheap, chances are is that it wouldn't last long. Expensive grow tents also doesn't mean that they're of high quality. So you want to take note of that.\nThe brand or the maker of the grow tent is where you can know if it will last a long time. It's another factor in knowing the product's durability. If the maker of the grow tent has been in the business for a long time and that they are reputable, then that's a good sign that you're picking the right to grow tent.\nThe best product out of the five reviewed grow tents is the TopoLite Multiple Size Grow Tent. It\u2019s sturdy, made of high quality materials, and fairly easy to install. And thanks to these good thing, there\u2019s no doubt that your plants are going to grow in a speedy way with high quality yields. This is surely the best choice you can make.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/cocacrop.com\/best-grow-tents\/"}

{"text":"Vicor\u2019s new MIL-COTS VI Brick Filter provides a transient and EMI filtering DC front end to protect MIL-COTS power conversion systems, which complies with stringent military standards. It is available either as a stand-alone filter, or as an integrated Filter\/PRM Regulator Module. Substantially smaller than competing products with similar power ratings, both versions of the MIL-COTS VI Brick Filter provide compliance with MIL-STD-1275A\/B\/D for transients, and MIL-STD-461E\/F for EMI conducted emission and conducted susceptibility. The stand-alone Filter also complies with MIL-STD-704A\/E\/F for input transients, while the Filter\/PRM Module complies with MIL-STD-704A-F.\nBoth versions of the Filter are designed to operate as part of a Vicor Factorised Power Architecture (FPA) power conversion system. FPA solves the demands created by today\u2019s component densities, proliferation of onboard voltage levels, and ever faster transient response requirements. It provides high density, high efficiency, low noise operation, architectural flexibility, extremely fast transient response and elimination of bulk capacitance at the point-of-load (POL).\nThe integrated Filter\/PRM Module, with an efficiency of approximately 95%, is a non-isolated regulator capable of both boosting and bucking a wide range of input voltages from 16.5 to 50 VDC. It provides a controlled FPA Factorised Bus distribution voltage for powering downstream MIL-COTS VI BRICK VTM current multipliers that provide fast, efficient, isolated, low noise POL converters. This combination of MIL-COTS VI Brick Filter and MIL-COTS VI Brick VTM provides a complete MIL-COTS EMI and transient filtered DC \u2013 DC converter subsystem with all the benefits of Vicor\u2019s Factorised Power Architecture (FPA). With an output power of 120 W, the stand-alone version of the Filter can be used in front of MIL-COTS Brick and V.I Chip PRMs to gain the same benefits.\nThe new VI Brick Filter is typically used in military ground vehicle and airborne systems. Examples of ground vehicle applications include communications, targeting systems, flat panel displays, RF jamming and GPS mobile tracking. It provides design flexibility in minimal space, where military standard EMI and transient protection is essential.","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/powerblog.vicorpower.com\/2010\/09\/new-mil-cots-vi-brick-filter-adds-mil-std-transient-and-emi-compliance-to-power-conversion-design\/"}
{"text":"Home \u00bb Headlines \u00bb Editorials \u00bb Do You Know How Many of Your Visits Are From Mobile?\nWe are never far from our mobiles. Whether we are relaxing at home or running errands, most of us have our mobiles handy.\nMobile phone usage continues to rise and in the modern-day, the device most used for the internet is mobiles.\nBut do you know how many of your visits are from mobile? Read-on to discover how you can find that out.\nAccording to data collected by Statista in 2018, 52.2% of all website traffic came from mobiles, up nearly two percentage points from 50.3% in 2017.\nIn 2017, it was revealed that 65.1% of all web traffic in Asia comes from mobiles and in Africa, 59.5% of web traffic comes from mobile.\nIn the United States, there are more very revealing statistics surrounding mobile phone usage.\nIn 2017, page views of sites stood at 53% from mobiles and 47% from desktops. Also, in almost every industry analyzed, the share of mobile page views went up whereas the share of desktop page views went down in comparison to the previous year.\nGambling, for example, showed an 11% increase in mobile phone usage, demonstrating the increasing trend towards the mobile casino in that industry.\nSimilarly, the same study showed that the total visits of sites from mobiles stood at 63% in 2017 and desktop visits stood at 37%.\nFurthermore, according to Google, over half of search queries globally come from mobile devices which, given the above statistics, isn\u2019t exactly surprising.\nGoing forward, all signs are pointing towards increasing numbers of people using mobiles over other devices when they use the internet.\nIf you are wondering how to track mobile phone usage to your site, you will be happy to know that it is a straightforward process.\nIn mind of these statistics, businesses ought to be doing everything they can to optimise the mobile sites of their business.\nThe way to do this is through mobile responsive design. Through using responsive design, your site will reformat and resize in accordance with the device the site has been accessed on.\nThis means that all those mobile users who access your site will be met with a site which functions smoothly and effectively.\nGood mobile design will give your visitors a favourable impression of your company or site.\nContrarily, if your site is poorly adapted for mobile devices, your visitors are likely to go off your site and look elsewhere.\nAlso, Google are prioritising mobile over desktops and laptops. Google now rewards those sites which offer mobile responsive design.\nThrough mobile-first indexing, Google ranks websites based on the mobile site rather than the desktop\/laptop version.\nEvidently, it is vitally important for any business or site to have a good mobile design. If this is not the case, the site will suffer considerably in Google rankings, something no business or site wants.\nIt is clear that mobile internet usage is only going to increase going forward. For any business or site, it is a good idea to keep an eye on your mobile users and, crucially, optimise your mobile site.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.pulseheadlines.com\/visits-mobile\/72554\/"}

The length of the bridge is 1,246 meters (pontoon section). This combined cable- stayed and pontoon bridge adjacent to the city of Bergen attaches the mainland and the island of flat, spanning Salhusfjorden, that has 500m depth. It conveys two lanes for cars and a pedestrian \/ bicycle path. The floating section belongs to a steel box girder on top of 10 concrete pontoons, each contains nine watertight cells.\nBergsoysund Bridge, Norway was developed in 1992 and the length of the bridge is 933 meters. The bridge attaches the islands of Aspoya and Bergsoya, covering a fjord with a water depth of 320 meters.\nThe engineering firm Johns Holt made the design of the pontoons and abutments, and DNV Veritec made the design of the steel superstructure. Norwegian Contractors developed the concrete pontoons, and Akeer Verdal developed the steel pipe truss superstructure . It is supported with seven concrete pontoon foundations.\nWilliam R. Bennett Bridge, British Columbia, Canada was developed in 2008. The length of the bridge is 690 meters. The five- lane bridge is on nine pontoons with width 25m and the length varies from 25 m to 90 m.\nYumemeai Bridge, Osaka, Japan is 410 meters long. This floating swing bridge attaches two artificial islands, Yumeshima and Maishima, in Osaka Bay. A floating bridge design was chosen due to the soft ground of the reclaimed land. The bridge\u2019s double arches are supported with two large steel pontoons. The pontoons were designed to avoid corrosion by binding their sides with titanium plates as well as a cathodic protection system.\nThe floating section of Evergreen Point Floating Bridge is 2,350 meters. The six- lane bridge conveys State Route 520 over Lake Washington from Seattle to its eastern suburbs. It involves 77 concrete pontoons which are attached to the lake bottom with 58 anchors tethered to steel cables.\nTwenty- one of the pontoons that provide support to the deck and superstructure are each 110 m x 23 m x 8.5 m and weigh 10,000 tonnes. Fifty- four supplemental pontoons were applied to settle the weight of the bridge weigh 2,300 tonnes each.

{"text":"The 19 ft Grady I am working on has a moderate gradually curved hook that peaks at about 3\/8\" about 2.5 feet in front of the transom. How important is it to have water in the hull during the time that force is applied to gradually work the hook out? Could keeping water in the hull for weeks or even months cause rot and other damage to the garboards, rib ends, keelson and stringers? Does Anyone have a success story and advice on working a hook similar to this description out? Thanks!\ndon't soak the wood! this will just cause rot, as you figured.\nyou could try steaming, but i don't think that you can get the ribs soft enough. i assume they are oak?\n1, with the boat upside down, running a strong batten along the the outside and use bolts and pads on the inside to slowly, over time, draw the bottom as close to fair as will reasonably happen.\n2, fair the bottom with fairing compound. then cover the bottom panels with 1\/4 ply sheathing epoxed and screwed.\ni am currently drawn to option 2, as option 1 would most likely require option 2 any ways to get the bottom fair. just less compound.\ni plan to do the 1\/4 sheathing in either case. i know this will increase weight and change the bottom by filling the first lap. but it will also strengthen the bottom. and if it overly affects the ride, i will add bilge keel strips.\nactually, in thinking it through today, i am now thinking about removing the bottom panels, fairing the warped ribs and replacing new bottom panels.\ni will have to see what i find when i get there.\ni also plan to reinforce the bottom structure with bulkhead floors of ply wood.\nI have the same hook issue. It very much affects the handling of the boat.\nThen fill the voids in and around the strips with Smith's filler and sand it all fair. Coat just the garboard panels with Smith's CPES. Then of course, paint!\nThe problem of the \"hooked\" bottom is all too common on our old wood boats. Expanding on Robert's plan #1 idea, I have wondered if the following would work.... Three strong timbers (6X6's) as strong backs under the hull (hull in the upright position) extending from aft of the transom to well forward and in line with the three structural longitudinal hull members, keel and the two stringers. With holes drilled thru the bottom planks, adjacent to the members, long clamp bolts (threaded rod) with plates drawing the hull members down. The strong back timbers would have to be spaced out from true plane position to allow for some over compensation to compensate for likely spring back. All the load being applied to the three structural hull members, no direct load on the plank, ribs or the plank to transom joint.\nPerhaps a little TEMPORARY moisture inside the bilge and weight could help move things along. All done , only a few small holes in the garboard planks to be plugged.\nThank you for all the input. I'll throw out and an idea I'm considering to try and pull the hog down. After removing the outer keel and blocking the hull upright, including blocks on the keel line at the transom and just forward of the hog, I am considering anchoring a fixture to the concrete floor with a turnbuckle and threaded rod running up through the inner keelson. I would make a fixture to span the keelson and stringers to either side which the threaded rod would pass through. Over the winter, I would periodically adjust the turnbuckle to gradually encourage the wood to straighten out by pulling downward. The ribs are white oak, and appear to still be strong. Any comments on whether this could make an improvement? Thanks again.\ni don't think that you would get the stringers and keelson to bend permanently back to original shape. too large dimensionally. maybe the ply and the ribs. maybe with a lot of steam. but i think that this would just weaken the old wood.\ni have been thinking on this a lot for at least a year! i'm thinking that trying to get the ribs and ply to bend again would just weaken the fibers and not be strong long term. with or with out steam.\ni am actually going back to the idea of scabbing wood into the divots with epoxy, as described by thegammas then adding reinforcing on the inside.\nbasically fixing it in the position it is in. fairing the bottom and strengthening the structure so there wont be anymore (i hope) distorting.\nWell, it took a long time for the hog to form from letting the boat sit on something that pushed it up due to the weight of the boat itself, so why not try reversing the process? Maybe setting a large weight on the inside of the boat (like an engine block) would perform the same thing in reverse? It would take time though.\nJust a word of caution, I would strongly advise against simply adding weight to the inside of the hull. I expect that that will only succeed in destroying the joinery at the transom. Any force applied downward must be counteracted with an equal and opposite force acting (up) against the transom joint.\nI understand that consideration. My suggestion would to be to support all the areas under the hull that are not hogged and only apply the inside weight over the hog.\nI have been out looking at 16' and 17' Thompsons and Lyman's from the 1950's and am amazed how many have a pronounced hook in the bottom. One seller suggested I need only soak the boat and add weight for some period for this to correct itself. Certainly not, and the issue of mold and rot was already identified in this thread. In thinking about what I have seen, why not unfasten the bottom planks from the ribs, and\/or the ribs from the keel in the affected portion of the bottom, and insert shims of the appropriate wood type (white oak?) and length, then reattaching everything? I, for one, don't believe a keel can be easily straightened, despite the imaginative approaches raised earlier in this thread (impressive imaginations, actually), and the idea of adding layers of epoxy has its own issues. Surely, I cannot be the first to think of shims - what's wrong with the idea?\nI like the last idea. Sounds practical enough to make an array of measurements from straight at each fastener location and make custom shims based on each measurement. With the ribs being white oak, it seems logical to me to make the shims from white oak as well. I would need to shim between the inner keel and the bottom planks as well. If I decide to give this approach a try, I'll report back over the winter on how it works. Let me know if we are missing anything regarding this approach. Thanks!\nI think that it is all relative to the given situation.\nif one simply has warping to the bottom panels and ribs, and you can soak and press them back to shape, fine. though i think that over time, ie several soakings, this will cause damage, and or the wood will just become overly flexible.\non the other hand, if like me your situation is such that the whole structure, panels, ribs, stringers and keel are all hogged, then soaking won't be effective. for me, one of the stringers was even being pushed up off of the transom.\ni also don't like the idea of shimming between the ribs and bottom because this will alter the structural relationship. the strength comes from ribs sitting firm and being fastened tight to the panels and planks. in addition, all the years of these parts being tight to each other, and then separating them doesn't seem like a good idea to me. i feel that correcting the hog in place is more structurally sound. that is filling and fairing the bottom. in addition, this will add strength to these areas. unless of course what is needed is more rebuilding of the bottom.\nand if the depth of the hog is 1\/4 inch or more, i would shape a piece of plywood to fit into the hollow, and then fair it to the bottom.\nThe correct fix would be to replace ribs, garboards, keelson, and keel. Short of doing this will be a compromise. Another compromise would be to add trim tabs, I have seen a lot on older wooden boats. .\nInteresting and creative solutions to a nasty and tricky problem. If I were approaching this problem, I would reject the notion of moisture and pressure to reverse what has likely taken 30-50 years to create. The wood fibers have assumed a new and quite permanent direction creating the \"hog\". While you might be able to temporarily get all members to assume a straightened bottom, I would submit that the solution would be relatively short lived before the members return to their deformed shape.\nI believe the oak shim suggestion from Brad on all ribs, keel and sisters are the best solution. As you acknowledged Rich, this plan has some merit. I think your time and efforts will be well utilized if you can identify the specific deformed members and insert tapered, fitted shims glued and fastened in place. I would error on being slightly more in thickness than less.","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/www.thompsondockside.com\/phpBB3\/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=4317&p=12210"}
{"text":"Projects that focus directly on the needs for the buyer generally have more powerful outcomes than patients that concentrate on the product alone. So the desire to keep a client happy is without question paramount to the majority of project managers \u2013 they know that the customer must sign-off at the completed job and if they can be not satisfied while using the end-result then job will not be considered profitable. Nonetheless on the other hand task management supervisor also has to keep a good grip about finances as well as the project timetable, which by natural means means handling requests for the purpose of change. In the event the scope of the project begins to diverge significantly from the main requirements then your consumer may be completely happy with the finale product nonetheless they will absolutely certainly not end up being happy with the budget and\/or time over-run. Just how does indeed a task manager position the client\u2019s requires first when they want to switch details of the project part-way through the program but even so be capable of deliver a quality product upon budget, on time and within scope?\nTask managers on a regular basis face this kind of challenge and their skills in managing people, budgets, daily activities and deadlines are all vital for many of these occasions. Clientele carry out not generally appreciate the outcomes of a seemingly simple adjustment. When a transformation is needed once the project is already happening it can always be a lot more costly to put into action than whether it had recently been inbuilt by an preceding stage. Task plans normally have many tasks running in similar and often contain complicated inter-dependencies so any kind of change may result in huge risk to the successful finalization of the project. However it would always be naive to assume that transform for no reason happens in a project or perhaps that wanted adjustments are not important to implement, which can be, of course, for what reason change operations is considered this important a part of a task plus the final responsibility of the job manager. Task managers exactly who are used to dealing face-to-face with customers know that it is simply not acceptable to show down a big change request with no extremely great justification that can end up being saved with facts. More usually the job executives encourage the enhancements made on order to show that that they are supportive and versatile and adding the customers desires first. Employing purchase to offset the effect in the asked switch they will require a great project managing method found in place as well as the best task managers will frequently try and discuss a compromise within just the innovative request to lessen its impact on the complete task or trade off the new requirements with considered one of a more affordable top priority that had been considered into the routine.\nSo what is the foremost method to implement a change control process?\nFirstly, it is important that best from the start within the project everybody involved understands that virtually any change in requirements have to be revealed through a formal modify get. Every change get published will need to after that get evaluated to ensure that all those changes which might be actually required or perhaps desirable are truly authorized. The purpose of the method is not to prevent transformation but to control it in order that it does indeed not jeopardise the accomplishment of the project. Quizzed changes are frequently the consequence of options that currently have arisen only since looking at improvement on a job in actuality. Many people believe that it is hard to think completely inside the get rid of or bring up fully to paintings, kinds or representative models so it is essential to recognize that many modification asks for will result in a better final product. It is actually, of program, also important to be capable to distinguish between a modification that will enhance the end-product and the one that is wrong and will only serve to delay delivery within the last item.\nAnd so an alteration request happens to be submitted and examined and deemed to become value examining additionally. The next step is to produce a proposal of just how prolonged the switch can take to implement and exactly how this might impact the existing routine, and also to weigh up the advantages of producing the adjustment with reverence to the negatives. All of the of these kinds of ideas ought to be written about and talked about with the customer. In the event that it is going to be decided that the switch should move forward this is significant to concur, concurrently, any increase in finances or complement within the achievement day when part of the formal agreement to the change. In the event that no additional time or funds can get specific and the customer still needs the modification then this is the time to negotiate a trade-off with one more, less essential task. In numerous businesses cutting edge ideas could be formed and developed swiftly so resistance to change will certainly not be an choice. Instead, to remain competitive an operation and its job professionals has to be in a position to manage changes in assignments in an productive way. Because of this , change operations processes are vital for the delivery of powerful projects and why modification management is normally part of many task supervision training courses found in methodologies such as PMP, PRINCE2 and APMP.\nChange is known as a fact of life generally in most projects, but how it is controlled and managed is important to the accomplishment of the project and to a satisfied customer.

My wife and I also went through this exercise.\nUnfortunately, my wife got pick-pocketed while we were in a large night market in Vietnam and was without a phone for the remainder of the trip. Thank goodness she barely uses her phone as it is.\nWhen we came back to the U.S. she was going to settle for a phone on Amazon.com which cost $222.79. The only thing is that she had a tough time finding a newer phone that wasn\u2019t too big for her hands.\nI then remembered I kept my old Honor 8 which was identical to the one she lost. The only problem was it couldn\u2019t hold a charge.\nToo bad battery replacements aren\u2019t as easy as popping out the back and popping in the battery. That didn\u2019t stop me though. I began looking up tutorials online, then ordered a battery replacement kit.\nWhen this battery replacement kit arrived, it took me around an hour from start to finish to install the battery.

{"text":"High up in the Picos de Europa mountains in the autonomous community of Asturias, lies the tiny parish of Sotres de Cabrales, Spain. The nearest school or grocery store is 45 minutes away, and the number of sheep and cows grazing on alpine pastures vastly exceeds the hamlet\u2019s human population.\nThere is a saying in the municipality of Cabrales that the higher the village, the better the cheese. And in Sotres de Cabrales, elevation 3,368 feet, there is a feeling that indeed, some of the best blue cheese in the world is made here. That\u2019s because every two days for 10 months of the year, the husband and wife team of Jessica Lopez and Javier Diaz craft Cabrales, a blue cheese made that must be made from unpasteurized cow\u2019s milk or blended in the traditional manner with goat and\/or sheep milk.\nAlthough Cabrales is a blue cheese, no blue mold spores are added to the milk during its production, and wheels are not pierced to allow the introduction of oxygen to facilitate any blooming of blue mold in man-made openings. Instead, during its production, cheese wheels are loosely pressed, and the cheesemaker relies on hundreds of years of blue mold built up in ancient limestone caves to naturally inoculate the wheels from the outside in to create one of the strongest, deepest blues in the world.\nAt Queseria Main in Sotres de Cabrales, Spain, every four days, Jessica, Javier, his father-in-law and brother-in-law transport the wheels of cow\/goat milk blended Cabrales that Jessica makes to three different natural limestone caves in the Picos de Europa mountains. One cave is fairly close, and wheels may be transported to within 200 feet of the cave opening via motor vehicle. Another cave is further away and accessible only by foot, which means each person packs between four and six wheels in special backpacks and then hikes to the cave opening to place the wheels on wooden boards deep inside. A third cave is too far away to carry cheese on foot, so wheels are placed in packs on horseback, and horses are led to the cave opening, where the cheeses will age for four to 10 months underground on wooden shelves. In each cave, after new cheeses are placed on wooden shelves, existing wheels are washed and flipped, and wheels ready for sale are transported back to the factory in Sotres de Cabrales.\nAll of the milk used in the production of Cabrales must come exclusively from animals in the region of Asturias, Spain. Cabrales is a PDO cheese (Protected Designation of Origin), and before gaining this protected status in 1981, was traditionally wrapped in leaves from the Sycamore Maple. Today, modern regulations require it to be sold in a dark-green-colored aluminum foil with the stamp of the PDO Queso de Cabrales.\nJavier and Jessica have been making cheese for 10 years, and learned the craft from her parents, who own another Cabrales creamery nearby. The parents also allowed them to start aging their cheeses in caves where they had rights to do so. In Cabrales, all of the natural caves have been claimed, and the only way a new producer can gain access to aging space is by inheriting a cave, or taking over a cave when another cheesemaker ceases production.\nIn addition to the cave granted to them by her parents, over the years, Javier and Jessica have gained access to two additional caves that were not being used (and with good reason \u2013 they are only accessible via horse or on foot), but the couple is young and eager to forge their way in the world, and works extremely hard in their Cabrales production.\nIn fact, they were extremely gracious this week and allowed my group of 20 Wisconsin Cheese Originals tour members to enter their nearest cave, a 15-minute hike down the mountainside. When we arrived, Javier hooked up a generator to provide light. He then unlocked a steel door inserted into a natural rock wall, and we descended down 40 steps into a natural limestone cave filled with wooden shelves of Cabrales cheese.\nJavier and Jessica are young, and at 10 years into cheesemaking, are successfully and slowly building their business to allow more people like us to view their cheesemaking and aging caves. After we hiked back up the mountain (and I tried not to die from being out of breath), the couple hosted us at picnic tables outside their creamery and filled us with tastings of their 4-month and 10-month wheels of Cabrales. paired with bread, fruits and quince paste.\nThis episode of Cheese Underground Radio is sponsored by Caves of Faribault, makers of cave aged blue cheeses in Faribault, Minnesota.

Caves of Faribault cheeses are the only cheeses in America aged in natural, underground sandstone caves. Learn more at www.FaribaultDairy.com.\nA few weeks ago, I called cheesemaker Tony Hook in Mineral Point with the idea of doing a story on what it was like to sell cheese at the largest producer-only farmer\u2019s market in the nation. Every Saturday morning from April to November, about 170 stands pop up on the capital square in Madison, Wisconsin. All of the items for sale are grown, raised, and produced by the person behind each table.\nTony told me he usually arrives by 4:45 a.m., so I told him I\u2019d see him there. I\u2019m not entirely sure he believed me, so as he navigated the orange construction barrels on Pinckney Street in his Chevy Tahoe and trailer at 4:40 am, he shook his head in disbelief as I greeted him at the curb.\n\u201cWell, you told me you\u2019d be here early, but I didn\u2019t think you meant this early,\u201d he said. As I helped him unload the trailer in the pitch dark under the light of a street lamp, it occurred to me how very quiet a city can be before dawn. Hell, even the swarms of squirrels that usually dot the capital grounds looking for leftovers weren\u2019t even up yet. And to think, in just a couple of hours, the market would be so crowded that customers three-deep would be vying to buy cheddar, blue and American original cheeses from the Hook\u2019s Cheese team.\nTony and his wife, Julie Hook, have been selling their cheeses at the Dane County Farmer\u2019s Market since 1994, and they have it down to a science. Tony is generally in charge of setting up the booth, and Julie is in charge of prep work \u2013 cubing cheeses, setting up everything on the tables, and making sure toothpicks are in the right spot.\nBut this week, Julie is missing, because she\u2019s getting a new knee in a few weeks, and standing on the cement aggravates the pain. So, Tony is happy to see another family member arrive \u2013 someone who actually knows what she\u2019s doing (unlike me) \u2013 and that\u2019s his sister, also named Julie. When he\u2019s talking about his wife and sister, he keeps his Julies straight this way: Julie Ann is his wife, and Julie Marie is his sister. Because they all work together in the same cheese plant, middle names are key when calling for a Julie.\nNow that Julie Marie is here, the set-up really begins to click along. We unload the Tahoe, which is filled to the absolute brim with more than a dozen giant square blue coolers, filled with dozens of varieties of cheeses, and each cooler is meticulously labeled with the contents. I get tasked with emptying little cubes of cheese from plastic baggies into individual sample containers, so that in another hour, customers can try each cheese before they buy it.\nBefore long, we look at our watches and it\u2019s already 6 a.m. The market officially opens at 6:15 a.m., so we snag Tony for a few minutes to talk cheese before the crowds descend, and Julie Marie promises to hold down the fort.\nBack in 1994, the Hooks sold at 10 different varieties of cheese. In 1997, they started making blue cheese. Today, they make 70 different varieties of cheese, including dozens of different ages of Cheddar and Swiss. They also specialize in making mixed milk cheeses, and are making more sheep and goat\u2019s milk cheeses every year. They purchase their sheep and goat milk each from one farm, while all the cow\u2019s milk cheeses come from three small farms, the largest of which milks 50 cows. These are the same three farms that have shipped milk to the Hooks since they started making cheese in Mineral Point in 1976. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep the little guys in business,\u201d Tony says.\nWe walk with Tony back to his cheese stand, and by now, it\u2019s already starting to get busy. People in this town love their Saturday morning farmer\u2019s market, and many come early to get the best selection. We walk past stands of apples, popcorn, organic vegetables and beautiful bouquets of flowers.\nOnce we\u2019re back at the Hook\u2019s booth, it doesn\u2019t take long for customers to start sampling and buying cheese. One customer wants to know the difference between different ages of cheddars, and Tony does a remarkable job of explaining in detail how acid plays a huge part in the flavor of cheese. His cheddars aged 2, 3, 5, and 6 years will be more acidic, while the cheddars aged 10 and 12 years are much smoother, sweeter and full of calcium lactate crystals. The customer purchases the 10-year cheddar. By the way, that\u2019s the same age cheddar Tony says he keeps in his fridge. Every day.\nToday\u2019s Cheese Underground Radio is sponsored by Dairy Connection Incorporated, supplier of cultures, enzymes, cheesemaking supplies and trusted expertise since 1999.

{"text":"Pablo Akaros is a Spanish DJ and producer from San Sebastian. His style is highlighted by a dark, eclectic and minimalistic approach. He also experiments with different sounds in a personal way and his new release for 2013 is a retrospective of what he likes most. His first LP at Darek Recordings includes ten original tracks to discover with attention. This time, he offers something different, maybe more mature and present, full of personal experiences. Primux LP is a strong release, with a deeper touch, to savor in its entirety. In 1994, Pablo began to work as a DJ in some local clubs and festivals, with different residences in Spain. Since 2004, his first productions were released at Upfront Records, followed by Meerestief and Intoxik. In 2006, he recorded his first EP on Karmarouge Noir, where he has several references. He also released his music at Miga, Offaudio and Flumo. In 2007 he created his own label Alertha Records, with participations of international artists.

{"text":"Abstract: This paper is a scoping review of the available evidence regarding health care issues in police custody. It describes the types and prevalence of health disorders encountered in custody and provides an overview of current practice and recent innovations in police custody health care. In contrast to the health of prisoners, the health of police custody detainees has, until recently, received little academic or clinical attention. Studies on health care in police custody identified for this review are limited to a few geographical jurisdictions, including the UK, continental Europe, North America, and Australia. There are significant health concerns among police detainees including acute injury, chronic physical health problems, mental and cognitive disorders, and the risks associated with drug and alcohol intoxication or withdrawal. There is some evidence that deaths in police custody have reduced where attention has been paid to the latter issue. Police personnel continue to experience difficulties identifying detainees with health issues relevant to their safe detention, but research shows that the use of evidence-based screening tools improves detection of such morbidities. Innovations in police custody health care mainly relate to detainees with mental disorders, including improved identification of illness, timely access to mental health services, the protection of the rights of mentally disordered detainees, and the diversion of mentally disordered persons from the criminal justice system into appropriate health and social care interventions. There is a lack of rigorous research relating to interventions for physical health problems, protecting those at risk of substance withdrawal, and detainees with preexisting or peri-arrest injures. Research to improve the health of police custody detainees requires greater priority, focusing on case identification and service redesign to address high levels of morbidity and to facilitate health promotion and prevention activities.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/police--custody-health-care-a-review-of-health-morbidity-models-of-car-peer-reviewed-article-RMHP"}

{"text":"Marriage might be a two-way process but it cannot hurt if one of the two parties will try harder to make the marriage work and become livelier. By trying harder, you don\u2019t really need to exert much effort but instead, just do something that can make you happier and more comfortable with your partner.\nAccording to statistics, about 50% of marriages in the US end up to divorce. Do you want your marriage to be one of those that end up in divorce? If not, you have to do something then as nothing is free in this world. What can you do?\nMen cannot seem to understand how hurtful it is for their partners to know that they are having a good time with other women even if that woman is just a paid one like one of the CIM Escorts. It will not only hurt them emotionally, it will also hurt their price making them think that somehow, they are not desirable anymore.\nThis might seem absurd but there is always a time when we act like a child. Yes, it might feel yucky inside but if you will imagine her as a child when she annoys you, you will find her adorable instead. You might even just laugh off your irritation of her.\nYou might say that this will never happen but wait until you will learn something really ridiculous while you are walking with your partner on the street. You might want to drag her right there and then. However, you should not do this as it will really make a lasting mark on your partner. Even if the issue is already taken care of, she might not forget what you did.\nIf this is what you expect, then it means that you have low standards in choosing someone to be your wife. If you are giving credits to your wife, then you should accept that at times, she can be right and you can be wrong.\nAnd lastly, before flaring up that might end up to something you will regret for the rest of your life, learn how to put yourself in her shoes. Try to see her point of view and don\u2019t be such a narrow-minded husband.","timestamp":1556,"url":"http:\/\/www.gwynweddings.com\/how-to-avoid-thinking-about-divorce.html"}

{"text":"L'Enfant Gallery at the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and P Street NW.\nIn 2000, when Peter Colasante decided to move in, the once-elegant storefront on the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and P Street, formerly an Italian men\u2019s shop, was boarded up. The art gallery he was relocating from Connecticut Avenue was named for architect and engineer Pierre Charles L\u2019Enfant (Colasante didn\u2019t consider the 1960s office complex\u2014L\u2019Enfant Plaza\u2014a fitting tribute to the designer of the District of Columbia).\nColasante, 67, is still pleased with his choice of location, calling Georgetown \u2014 outside of New York, which he says is \u201ca different universe\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe best place in the best city in the country to be.\u201d The gallery\u2019s window displays, meant to be \u201cvisual out-of-the-box experiences,\u201d draw in the avenue\u2019s enviable foot traffic. \u201cI find out who they are later,\u201d he says.\nBy now, the gallery has an international network of clients, a \u201cnuclear family.\u201d Dealers look to L\u2019Enfant Gallery for Chinese art and Asian ceramics, and the Civil War is a focus (Colasante lent items to a major Lincoln exhibition recently), but the overall mix is eclectic in genre, origin and price.\nStepping inside, visitors face a red wall of paintings hung salon-style, assorted chandeliers above. That sense of rich surprise extends throughout the gallery\u2019s four levels.\nIn November, after a volunteer archivist went through what was in storage, Colasante opened the gallery\u2019s basement to the public. It is now set up to resemble a Victorian viewing parlor, complete with a carved chief\u2019s throne from Borneo.\nHaving decamped for Vienna, Virginia, Colasante no longer gets up at 3 in the morning to move paintings around. But he and his business partner (and former spouse) Maureen Taylor rearrange the display and host special exhibitions every few months. From total holdings of roughly 4,000 objects, he says they sell 200 to 300 per year.\nColasante\u2019s eyes twinkle behind stylish frames when he recalls starting out with a much smaller inventory. In December of 1973, he opened Calvert Gallery in an English basement on Connecticut Avenue, putting four things purchased at apartment sales in the window. The gallery grew as it moved from one location to another in the vicinity of Connecticut and Calvert, becoming L\u2019Enfant Gallery in 1990.\nRaised in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, Colasante attended Catholic University, where he failed to shine, as he tells it, either as an actor or a philosopher. He learned about art working in Oxon Hill, Maryland, as an eccentric collector\u2019s cataloguer, then curator. His boss\u2019s advice: Never specialize.\nColasante can remember three recessions, but calls the last five years \u201cthe worst it\u2019s ever been.\u201d The threshold for bread-and-butter purchases, formerly $10,000, has dropped to $3,000, he says. The good news is that he owns his building, having finally been able to purchase it from a trust in 2012. He also does appraisal work and counsels owners of art and antiques (he advises those wishing to hang on to treasured possessions to avoid the three Ds: death, divorce and downsizing).","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/georgetowner.com\/articles\/2016\/02\/18\/sense-rich-surprise-lenfant-gallery\/"}

We want satisfied users, not ones who feel trapped or upset.\nThat said, our user-base is large enough that literally every decision we make will delight some users and upset or outrage others, so our usual approach is to take in as much feedback as we can and use our own judgment about the best way forward, knowing that we quite literally can't please everyone.\nWhy is 1Password not offering me a way to disable the reused password notification? Why is the UX\/UI team unaware of the extreme effects this has on usability?\nThis has been addressed in multiple threads in this forum already, so please feel free to browse those if you'd like a fuller discussion of the issue, but briefly, we are indeed aware. What we're looking into are ways to allow greater flexibility for more-advanced users while not allowing newer, less-sophisticated users to turn off warnings they probably should be seeing without being able to just dismiss them in such a way that they may not even know they're no able to see these warnings even when they're appropriate\/necessary. But again, since we're not likely to have that concluded within 30 days, you may want to take that into account. Thanks for writing in to let us know your wishes on this issue, and good luck with whatever you end up deciding!\nI could not love this response more if I tried!! Kudos!\nThat being said... I add my vote for \"an advanced mode to disable notifications for users who know better but choose to live in blissful uncertain insecurity.\"\nOf course, I'm not one of those per se... (I may have a couple of intentional duplicates, but not as a general practice)... however, there are stubborn people in my life who use 1P more as an \"auto-login\" system and who will never, ever, ever do as we all recommend by having secure, impossible to remember, and unique passwords for every account.\nAlas, these folks (mostly older and the most vulnerable, I propose) insist on still having only one or two passwords that they know and can remember, and they use them for every account everywhere, only using 1P to track what sites for which they have accounts and to auto-populate the login window for them. They will never change. No matter how much data I present to them, no matter how much I assure them that it's safe and smart. It just won't happen.\nI understand any organization has to balance the intended method and application of their product with the various real ways the end-users could use the same product. So, while I shall refrain from tyrannical demands of expedited resolution deadlines, I do hope this feature can appear somewhere on the bottom of a developer's \"to do\" list.\n@eFlat7 - thanks for the kind words! We really don't enjoy disappointing users, despite what it apparently seems to some people. But we've grown to a size where our user base is diverse enough that we sometimes have people advocating for literally the exact opposite things from one another, in different threads. No matter what we do, someone's not going to be happy.\nI do hope this feature can appear somewhere on the bottom of a developer's \"to do\" list.\nIt already is, in the sense that we're quite aware there's a decent chunk of users who'd like to be able to defeat or suppress these warnings, and not without reason. It's more in the \"we need to figure out how to do this in a way that's secure and works best for everyone\" stage, not the \"we've got a roadmap and it's happening soon\" stage. But yes, it's something we're continuing to look at\/work on. Thanks for adding your voice and your positivity to this thread.\nI know I am kind of resurrecting a dead thread, but have you considered an option where an advanced user can tick a box that says \"If login is identical in all aspects (modified on, attachments, fields, etc) and is in a different vault, do not display duplicate password warning\" or similar? I have shared vaults with different people or persons which include the login to various services (Netflix, etc) and I would hazard a guess that 90% of my duplicate logins fall under this scenario. It would be great if a starting point was to eliminate identical login entries from the list!\nIt's something to consider, but the problem is that most of the people requesting this sort of option are not dealing with completely identical items, so it wouldn't help very many folks. I think we need to allow for some flexibility.\n+1 I get this everywhere because of duplicate Vaults, that I don't want to remove yet.\nActually, it feels like a bug that a Vault excluded from All Vaults is considered for duplicates.\n@roninXpl: We definitely want 1Password telling the user about any duplicate passwords it knows about. Otherwise I'm not sure what a \"Duplicate passwords\" feature would be good for.

For those doing the math, that\u2019s 40 pounds in only four years. Not too shabby.\nThough his atomic metabolism would incinerate just about anything he consumed, including junk food, Williams was careful and diligent about his nutritional choices. He made balanced meals and carried his food with him to college, noshing between classes and at the library. \u201cI shot for 4,500 to 5,000 calories daily,\u201d he says. \u201cThat translated to about five to six solid, healthy meals and several protein shakes a day.\u201d Extreme, yes, but it worked: Williams was back up to 150 pounds in short order, and there he stayed.\nBut a hardgainer\u2019s struggle is never over: Williams is still on the size train, working toward his goal weight of 160 pounds. To keep progressing, he hits each bodypart twice a week in the gym, taking one full day off from training on Sundays, and prefers a rep range of six to 12. \u201cHigher reps give you definition and lower reps add mass,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes I max out for fun, just to see where I am in terms of strength, but most of the time, I stick to the six to 12 range.\u201d He is also keeping up with his super-sized 5,000-calorie diet.\nThe best moves for gaining mass are compound, complex motions that use a lot of muscle groups at once.

{"text":"Fukuoka\/Tokyo, July 16, 2014 \u2013 A campaign to promote recognition among Japanese of Kumamoto Prefecture as a major producer of fine foods has won Dentsu Kyushu Inc. and Dentsu Public Relations Inc. the prestigious \u201cPromotional Activity of the Year\u201d award at the PRWeek Awards Asia 2014.\nThe winning campaign, \u201cWhere are my cheeks?! Mouth-watering, cheek-dropping delicious Kumamoto produce\u201d, traced a personal loss involving the prefecture\u2019s cuddly mascot character \u2018Kumamon\u2019 and helped Kumamoto enjoy a 10% jump in food sales last year.\n\u2018Where are my cheeks?!\u2019 also won a \u201cCertificate of Excellence\u201d for the award category \u201cPublic Sector Campaign of the Year\u201d for public campaigns, and the \u201cJapan\/South Korea Campaign of the Year,\u201d a regional award.\nDentsu Kyushu and Dentsu Public Relations were the only recipients from Japan at this year\u2019s PRWeek Awards Asia event, held in late June at Marriott Hotel in Hong Kong and organized by the trade journal Campaign Asia-Pacific.\nPRWeek Awards Asia 2014 attracted 525 entries from the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 a 42% increase on 2013 \u2013 each vying for recognition in 39 categories.\nEach entry campaign was judged by a 42-person panel comprising industry leaders from PR companies, corporations and organizations, and the names of agencies submitting entries were removed to ensure impartially.\n\u201cThe campaign was particularly successful thanks to Kumamon, whose warm character lent the promotion originality. It was also a new media plan and PR strategy where great attention was paid to contents design and structure,\u201d Dentsu Public Relations President and CEO Takehiko Chikami said.\n\u201cWe are thrilled that it successfully contributed to rejuvenating the livelihood of Kumamoto\u2019s agricultural producers and increasing the brand value of Kumamoto\u2019s produce,\u201d he said.\nCentral to the one-week campaign were the mascot\u2019s red rosy cheeks \u2013 symbolizing Kumamoto Prefecture\u2019s \u201cred\u201d agricultural and marine products including tomatoes, strawberries, watermelons, beef and sea bream \u2013 which one day mysteriously disappear. The incident of Kumamon\u2019s missing cheeks and their subsequent recovery earned Kumamoto wide media exposure as a food-producing region.\n\u201cFusing creativity and PR together truly created an ideal model promotion,\u201d said the campaign\u2019s chief PR planner, Tadashi Inokuchi.\n\u201cBy gradually revealing the contents such as progress of the cheeks search, we used our understanding of mainstream media, social media and SNS these days to continuously trickle information to effectively seize the public\u2019s interest,\u201d he said.\nDentsu Kyushu was founded in 1995 as a regional advertising agency to prosper and grow with the local region.

{"text":"Claudius was born in Holstein and was the son of a pastor. His first literary achievement, and perhaps the best known in his own time, was as editor of Der Wandsbecker Bote, a newspaper with which he became completely identified and to which he was the principal contributor under the pseudonym of 'Amsmus'. Claudius's created a cosy, intimate literary style for the readership of his newspaper, a style which was popular without being cheap, and religious without being rigid or dour. In cultivating this conversational tone with his readers he was one of the pioneers of popular journalism in Germany; a number of his poems were adopted by the German public as folksongs. He was an extremely happy family man and although he took up other appointments he was never as contented as in Wandsbeck where he returned in 1777 after a spell as an adminstrator in Darmstadt. He was in touch with Goethe and Herder although he avoided the honours and the trappings of public life enjoyed by his distinguished contemporaries.","timestamp":1555,"url":"https:\/\/www.hyperion-records.co.uk\/c.asp?c=C1140"}

{"text":"We all get bruised up every once in a while. Whether we get hit, bang our leg or arm on something, or fall down. Bruises are easy to get, especially kids and the elderly. Some people bruise easier than others and will look like they just got beaten up pretty bad. Luckily, there are things a person can do from home to eliminate bruises and not look so beaten up all the time.\nPutting ice on the bruise in the first 24 hours of it will help get rid of it before it gets too bad. Use an ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables to stop the bruise in it\u2019s tracks. Apply the ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables for 15 minutes. Allow your skin to warm naturally and then apply the ice pack again for another 10 minutes. Do this every four or five hours on the first day to rid the skin of the ugly bruise. If you don\u2019t have an ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables, you can wrap some ice in a towel and use that. Cold reduces inflammation and helps ease the pain caused by the bruise.\nWrap an elastic bandage around the bruise and elevate the injured area to help drain blood from the area. Blood is affected by gravity and propping up your leg or arm where the bruise is will help it heal faster.\nThe day after using the ice pack, use heat on the bruise to help improve circulation. Use a heating pad or a warm, wet washcloth on the bruise to help it heal faster.\nIf you have a problem with too much bruising, eat more foods rich in vitamin C. Vitamin C helps prevent bruises and helps them heal faster. Studies show that vitamin C helps build collagen tissues around blood vessels in the skin. Foods rich in vitamin C include broccoli, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, and citrus fruits. You can also take vitamin C in supplement form but do not take more than 2,000 milligrams a day and only during the duration of the injury. High doses of vitamin C should not be taken without a doctor\u2019s supervision.\nSome people who have had problems with bruises have had success with comfrey poultices. Place comfrey leaves in hot water and spread them on a warm, wet washcloth. Press the comfrey poultice on the bruise. Do not ingest comfrey leaves because they can be dangerous when taken internally. Do not place on open wounds either. You can grow comfrey leaves yourself or buy them at any health food store.\nSt. John\u2019s Wart has anti-bacterial and astringent properties and have been known to work good for healing bruises. Add a few drops of St. John\u2019s Wart tincture to an organic oil or cream and apply it to the bruised area to help it heal faster.\nBy using the home remedies above, you can heal bruises faster and prevent them in the future.\nIt would be best to follow a healthy well balanced diet, as healing is at its optimum, when the body is well nourished.\nCertain foods like dairy products, white flour, sugar and processed foods are best avoided as they can delay recovery.\nInclude garlic and onions in your diet. According to some naturalists garlic can help facilitate healing because of its natural anti-microbial properties.\nEnsure that your diet is rich in vitamin C and iron. Citrus fruits and fresh vegetables like sweet potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli and all fresh fruits contain vitamin C and essential vitamins that help in tissue building and tissue recovery.\nDrink lots of water and healthy fluids like herbal tea, soups, fresh fruit juices.","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/www.hashmidawakhana.org\/home-remedies-for-bruises.html"}

{"text":"The new Inheritance allowance \u2013 is it a bit of damp squib?\nIn 2015 George Osborne announced a new inheritance allowance of up to \u00a31 million tax free as from 2020 if an estate is left to children or grandchildren. Raising the previous tax-free allowance from \u00a3325,000 to \u00a3500,000 per person, which means that married couples or those people in a civil partnership can inherit as much as \u00a31 million from an estate, tax free.\nIt will then rise with in-line with CPI, consumer Price Index from 2021 to 2022.\nIn a recent article published by Property Industry Eye they question whether homeowners have been sold a dud, as the problem with this new threshold seems to be that house prices in some parts of the UK, for example London and the South East are rising faster than the new tax allowance. It could also have a negative effect on available housing for those people trying to move up or even buy a first time house as people who own more expensive houses are forced to sell their properties and move into smaller properties to avoid going over the new inheritance threshold.\nCritics are saying that the Government has introduced these changes to appeal to the masses and are instead hitting investors hard by increasing Stamp Duty and reducing the relief on the mortgage interest.\nIf you would like to find out more information about recent changes to Stamp Duty, Inheritance tax or any other property related issue why not pop into your local branch of Intercounty for a coffee and a chat or call our team on 01279 655248.","timestamp":1556,"url":"https:\/\/www.intercounty.co.uk\/blog\/the-new-inheritance-allowance-is-it-a-bit-of-damp-squib"}
{"text":"infotiate.com \u2013 Refresh your mind with facts of Diet and Lifestyle\u2026..\nSince a long time we have been convinced by medical research literature that cholesterol and fats are the culprits for causing obesity and heart disease. Obesity is a medical condition in which the person is overweight due to excessive accumulation of fat. This excessive fat has negative effects on health of a person and leads to decreased life expectancy and makes the person more prone to health problems. Obesity leads to insulin resistance ,high blood pressure and ultimately to heart disease.\nOur minds need to be refreshed by the fact that cholesterol and saturated fats like ghee have been removed from the list of bad food substances that cause heart disease. In fact cholesterol is an important nutrient that is essential for the cell membranes, making of hormones like cortisol and progesterone. It helps in producing bile salts that help in digesting fats ,and its most important task is its conversion into vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight. Researchers have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to blame the dietary saturated fats for causing heart disease or strokes. They have found that insulin resistance and inflammation are the two main factors responsible for causing chronic diseases in addition to the genetic element. A strong family history of Diabetes Mellitus and Heart Disease is an alarm for the family members to improve their lifestyle .\nReducing intake of carbohydrates-Excessive intake of carbohydrates raises the blood sugar and the high levels of blood sugar initiate a chain of reactions ultimately ending on producing inflammation . This inflammatory process has been linked with a number of diseases as Alzeimer\u2019s, cancer and advanced aging.\nExercise\u2014Exercise and workouts help in utilizing the carbohydrates and lipids in body. You should start with strolling and walking. Gradually increase the number of steps to 5000- 10000 per day . Strenuous exercise is not advised as it may trigger inflammation.\nReduce Stress\u2014We hear people saying that\u201d I am not under stress ,\u201d but this is not possible in today\u2019s scenario . Stress can occur at any age and may be at any place . It can be at home, at work place or on way. Your job , family , finances or any other factor can bring stress in life. One has to try and reduce stress in their lives. Stress is itself responsible for causing inflammation.\nAntioxidants\u2014You should take diet rich in antioxidants as they help in controlling inflammation. Foods rich in antioxidants are vegetables and fruits, nuts and seeds ,fish, healthy fats as virgin coconut oil , extra virgin olive oil ,dark roasted sesame oil, ghee and butter which are organic and grass fed.\nFor a long time to reduce weight people have been advised low fat crash diets which have worked temporarily . When fat is reduced the bulk of diet consists of carbohydrates .These extra carbs again put on the weight. If low lipid diets were a cure for obesity in our country the incidence of obesity would have been low due to the prevailing economic conditions.In Indian diets carbohydrates are consumed maximally due to their lower costs as compared to cost of proteins and fats. Improvement in weight reduction has been seen once the lifestyle changes and dietary components are adopted. Avoid soda, avoid fast foods , avoid excessive sugars as fructose corn syrup and those substances which raise the blood sugar levels fast as all refined grains , processed foods, rice , fried potato .Include exercise in your daily routine life schedule. This should be a must for every one .\nPeople need to know that decreasing sugar intake, decreasing carbohydrates in diet and avoiding trans fats as in fast foods, biscuits,chocolates ,cheese, ready to eat snacks , toasts are the key factors for attaining the goal of reducing weight instead of cutting on the dietary cholesterol and saturated fats. It has been clearly established that cholesterol intake does not play a major role in increasing blood cholesterol levels as 80% of cholesterol is made in the liver and intestine irrespective of the amount of intake in diet.\nA very important advice to the consumer is to see the ingredients of the packed food articles specially for sugar and trans fats . All packets showing any amount of trans fats should not be eaten.","timestamp":1555,"url":"http:\/\/infotiate.com\/facts-of-diet-and-lifestyle\/"}
